      "Kim Kardashian Changed Her Password Again After Kanye West Used Her Phone To Tweet\\nThe beef between Kanye West and Drake is far from over, just hours after Kanye West appeared to settle their beef, the Chicago rapper hopped back on Twitter with over 80 tweets, claiming Drake “called trying to threatened me.” Kanye West Tweeted “So drake if anything happens to me or anyone from my family you are the first suspect— So cut the tough talk,”.\\nKanye even went as far as saying Drake wouldn’t even be where he is today without him.\\n“I’m the guy with the pink polo that made a way for him,” Kanye wrote. “There would never be a drake without a Kanye west so never come out your mouth with a threat.”\\nKanye’s phone must’ve died from tweeting so much that he took Kim Kardashians phone and tweeted pretending to be her but she later tweeted “DAMN NOW I GOTTA CHANGE MY PASSWORD AGAIN” giving us the assumption that it was Kanye West was tweeting and not Kim herself.\\n\\n

      "Blake Griffin Smacks Justin Bieber At Hollywood Starbucks\\nWEST HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA–\\n\\nJustin Bieber simply can’t seem to keep himself out of trouble.\\n\\nPolice were dispatched this morning to respond to an altercation at a Starbucks in West Hollywood involving some familiar faces.\\n\\nA barista at the coffee house was apparently confronted by Bieber  when he refused to serve the pop star because he wasn’t wearing a shirt.\\n\\n“He came in with no shirt on and his pants hanging down and underwear showing and tried to order a caramel apple machiatto.”, said Joey Goldsmith, the Starbucks barista, “I just told him he would have to put a shirt on if he wanted to order.”\\n\\nThat’s when Bieber snapped.\\n\\nAccording to the police report Bieber started cussing at the barista and threatening to have his bodyguard, “kick his ass”.\\n\\nFortunately for Goldsmith, LA Clippers star Blake Griffin had been enjoying a drink at a table when he witnessed  the altercation and stepped in.\\n\\nWitnesses at the scene reported that Griffin tried to calm Bieber but the Biebs wasn’t having any of it. There was more yelling, and some pushing and that’s when Griffin smacked Bieber, knocking him to the floor.\\n\\n“He smacked the shit out of him” said one witness, “then I saw Justin stumble out of the door looking like he was crying.”\\n\\nBieber was gone before police arrived at the scene.\\n

      "How lucky can you get! Incredible story of how man survives being hit by lightning TWICE in remarkable CCTV footage\\n\\nThe chances of being struck by lightning once are high enough.\\n\\nBut one unfortunate man appears to have been electrocuted twice within the space of a minute by two almighty bolts of lightning.\\n\\nThe hapless pedestrian had been jogging along a quiet city street when CCTV captured the astonishing moment on April 11.\\n\\nShortly before the apparent freak accident a walker carrying an umbrella and a jogger had passed through the street unscathed.\\n\\nThey are followed later by a young couple walking arm-in-arm as they shelter from what could be light drizzle.\\n\\nBut the unlucky man then jogs in from the bottom of the screen wearing dark trousers and a heavy coat.\\n\\nSeconds later a frightening bolt of electricity rips down from the heavens and zaps the man in his tracks.\\n\\nHe stumbles for a few feet before collapsing painfully face down onto the hard ground.\\n\\nAround his motionless body a dark shadow forms, which could be blood or scorched tarmac.\\n\\nAfter some 15 seconds the man begins to move his legs before struggling up from the ground. He clutches his head and sits for a moment to catch his breath.\\n\\nThe stunned jogger lifts himself up and goes on his way, resuming a brisk jog.\\n\\nBut seconds later after around ten yards a second bolt of powerful lightning strikes the man, knocking him to the ground again. Another dark shadow forms on the ground.\\n\\nThankfully, the man pulls himself to his feet and struggles away, even if he is a little confused by what just happened.\\n\\nThe astonishing video has become an internet sensation with thousands of people expressing their surprise that the unlucky man survived.\\n\\nThe chances of being struck by lighting once in a give year are around one in 700,000. The chance of being struck twice within such a short space of time are virtually unmeasurable.\\n\\nIt is not known where the video was recorded, although there is Chinese writing in the top corner of the screen.\\n\\nCynics suggested that so high was the probability of such a freak accident that the video might have been faked. \\n\\nSome internet users pointed to the lack of visible rain in the CCTV footage while one suggested that lightening hitting the ground would have caused the camera to shake.\\n\\nAnother stated that in the video the lightning lasted for only one frame, whereas, they said, real lightning would have 'overexposed the camera for at least a few frames on each strike'.\\n\\nBut other viewers said the video was genuine.\\n\\nOne wrote: 'Security cameras don't just shake every time it's windy don't they? Pause the video when the dude gets hit and look at the light, that's pretty hard to fake, don't you think?'\\n\\nAnother added: 'Photoshop can't make a thunder like that.

They could suffer minor burns and stroke-like symptoms. A doctor may later point to lightning strikes as the cause of injury.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "Country Music Legend Willie Nelson Dies at Age 81\\nLegendary country music star Willie Nelson was found dead today in his Maui home. He was 81 years old. Rumors of Nelson’s death first circulated early July 21, 2015 on social media outlets but was later confirmed by police.\\n\\nA groundskeeper scheduled to perform yard maintenance on Nelson’s property reportedly found the singer/songwriter unresponsive on the front lawn and immediately called 911.\\n\\n“There was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play,” said Det. Aldeson.\\n\\n“Determining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,” said County Coroner Frank Shultz. “It’s just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.”\\n\\nThe shocking news comes just days after a recent “60 Minutes” interview where Nelson was quoted as saying “Life is good and I have never felt better or been happier.”\\n\\nThis story is still developing and all

      "POPE FRANCIS CONDEMNS RACISM AND DECLARES THAT “ALL RELIGIONS ARE TRUE” AT HISTORIC THIRD VATICAN COUNCIL\\nFor the last six months, Catholic cardinals, bishops and theologians have been deliberating in Vatican City, discussing the future of the church and redefining long-held Catholic doctrines and dogmas. The Third Vatican Council, is undoubtedly the largest and most important since the Second Vatican Council was concluded in 1962. Pope Francis convened the new council to “finally finish the work of the Second Vatican Council.” While some traditionalists and conservative reactionaries on the far right have decried these efforts, they have delighted progressives around the world.\\n\\nThe Third Vatican Council concluded today with Pope Francis announcing that Catholicism is now a “modern and reasonable religion, which has undergone evolutionary changes. The time has come to abandon all intolerance. We must recognize that religious truth evolves and changes. Truth is not absolute or set in stone. Even atheists acknowledge the divine. Through acts of love and charity the atheist acknowledges God as well, and redeems his own soul, becoming an active participant in the redemption of humanity.\\n

      "Have Residents of Clint, Texas, been forcibly implanted with microchips by Jade Helm operatives?\\nPeople in the town of Clint, Texas are reporting that American soldiers have rounded up hundreds of civilians and forced them to submit to RFID implantation.\\n\\nCurrently Jade Helm 15 is operating just miles outside of Clint, Texas, leaving many to wonder if the two are related.\\n\\nJade Helm has been steeped in controversy since it was first announced by the military on March 23 2015, and concerned Texans have been on high alert for a potential gun-grab, or martial law scenario ever since. The governor of Texas has even deployed the National Guard to defend against any potential hostile takeover attempts. The US government has described Jade Helm as a military training exercise which focuses on specific terrains, but folks remain skeptical, and with good reason.\\n\\nSeveral eye witness reports state that residents in the small town were rounded up and brought to an abandoned shopping mall in the area. There they were given the choice between RFID implantation, or imprisonment in the makeshift military base.\\n

      "First Lady Michelle Obama to Propose National Hug a Muslim Day\\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama will unveil a proposal Monday that she hopes will ease tensions and work to counteract an ever growing Islamophobia gripping the nation. In an effort to strengthen relations and help build mutual trust with our two million Muslim Americans citizens, Michelle Obama is set to propose national “Hug a Muslim Day”.\\nThe proposed new federal holiday would eliminate and replace Columbus Day, first observed as a state holiday in 1906, and became federal in 1937. From now on, every second Monday in October would be recognized and observed as national, “Hug a Muslim Day.”\\n\\nThe proposed new federal holiday is already drawing mixed reactions from Americans,

      "Study: Fox News viewers have an IQ 20 points lower than the U.S. National average.\\n\\nThe results of a 4 year study show that Americans who obtain their news from Fox News channel have an average IQ of 80, which represents a 20 point deficit when compared to the U.S. national average of 100. IQ, or intelligence quotient, is the international standard of assessing intelligence.\\n\\nResearchers at The Intelligence Institute, a conservative non-profit group, tested 5,000 people using a series of tests that measure everything from cognitive aptitude to common sense and found that people who identified themselves as Fox News viewers and 'conservative' had, on average, significantly lower intelligent quotients. Fox Viewers represented 2,650 members of the test group\\n-----\\nTest subjects who received their news from other outlets or reported they do not watch the news scored an average IQ of 104, compared to 80 for Fox News viewers. \\n\\nLead researcher, P. Nichols, explains, \"Less intelligent animals rely on instinct when confronted by something which they do not understand. This is an ancient survival reaction all animals, including humans, exhibit. It's a very simple phenomenon, really; think about a dog being afraid of a vacuum cleaner. He doesn't know what a vacuum is or if it may harm him, so he becomes agitated and barks at it. Less intelligent humans do the same thing. Concepts that are too complex for them to understand, may frighten or anger them.\" \\n\\nHe continues, \"Fox News' content is presented at an elementary school level and plays directly into the fears of the less educated and less intelligent.\"\\n\\nRead more: http://www.city-data.com/forum/politics-other-controversies/1748756-study-fox-news-viewers-have-iq.html#ixzz5csAmy1yL\\n

      "TACO BELL MEAT\\nMONTGOMERY, AL – After allegations of false advertising, further investigation causes Taco Bell to close its doors for good.\\n\\nTaco Bell, the pseudo Mexican restaurant popular among college students, poor people, those without taste buds, and individuals with bad taste in general,  has recently been put on the stand for allegations regarding false advertisement.\\n\\nOn Friday, the law firm of Beasley, Allen, Crow, Methvin, Portis, Miles and another partner whose name no one can spell or pronounce, filed a law suit against the Mexican wannabe claiming that the meat mixture contains too many fillers and binders to be labeled as beef.\\n\\nThe majority of the time the meat mix is doused with so much cheese, salsa, and sour cream it is a wonder that anyone could tell it was beef flavored, much less question the authenticity of the meat itself.\\n\\nWeekly Would News knew that these allegations could only be just the tip of the iceberg so we sent our crack team of reporters to the streets to find out what else could be behind these allegations.\\n\\nIt did not take long for our team to discover that the meat that Taco Bell uses for its beef based products is imported from China. This set off a myriad of bells and whistles on our end so we asked our Japanese WWN affiliates to check out the Kuang Ren factory in the Zhejiang province where the beef is packaged. Within hours our Japanese colleagues were back in touch with a shocking discovery, the so called beef is actually cat and dog meat.\\n\\nWe all know that that the Chinese have been known to eat cat and dog meat but we never thought that they would have the cajones to import the goods to the US. Taco Bell would not return our phone calls, which leads us to believe that this must be true.\\n\\nUpon the discovery of the news, we immediately did the right thing and informed the FDA. The FDA has since mandated that all Taco Bells must be closed forever. So go get as many doggy burritos and kitty fajitas as you can before they are gone for good.\\n

      "14-Year-Old Girl Pregnant with Baby Jesus\\nROCKLAND — 14-year-old Amanda Peters hid her pregnancy from her mother for nearly three months until she began to show. When her mother Judy confronted her, Amanda denied having sexual intercourse and was taken immediately to a doctor who concluded she had likely been sexually active.\\n\\nThat’s when Amanda’s mother begged God to forgive her sinful daughter. However, her prayers were met strangely:  Judy claims God came to her in a vision and said he had impregnated Amanda through immaculate conception and that she was to give birth to Jesus.\\n\\n“At first I was confused, ” Mrs. Peters said. “Jesus was born to the Virgin Mary thousands of years ago, why was Amanda going to give birth to him again? But God explained this was how Jesus was to return to Earth as promised.”\\n\\nJudy told her daughter who was overjoyed that she was no longer grounded and had regained her phone privileges.\\n\\n“Things are the double bomb right now,” Amanda said. “My mom’s totally supportive and buying me lots of cool stuff I want and said she is going to pay for everything Jesus needs.”\\n\\n“I was so sick with grief over Amanda having sex,” Judy said. “And I’m now so happily relieved to know she’s still a virgin and this was all God’s doing. I can’t believe I’m going to be Jesus’ grandma… actually, I don’t know how that will work, but I’m just extremely happy my daughter isn’t having premarital sex and Jesus is coming back in less than a month.”\\n

      "Mom Calls 911 On Masturbating Teenage Son; Boy Arrested, Charged With New ‘Self-Rape’ Alabama State Law\\nAn Alabama teenager is being charged and held without bail, facing 3-15 years in prison over a new ‘Self-Rape’ state law implemented by AL Gov. Robert J. Bentley last month.\\n\\nMontgomery, AL — An Alabama boy is behind bars tonight after his mother called 9-1-1 when she found her son in his room, watching pornography and masturbating. Montgomery Police were quick to respond, arresting 15-year-old Paul Horner, who attends Jefferson Davis High School. The teenager is being held without bail and charged by prosecutors under a new controversial Alabama state law called ‘Self-Rape’, which carries a minimum of 3 years in prison with a maximum of 15 years behind bars depending on that individuals past criminal history.\\n\\nThis is the first time this new state law has been used since it was put into action last month by Alabama Governor Robert J. Bentley. Bently spoke with local news station WSFA 12 News about the charges against the boy.\\n\\n“I applaud the Alabama District court systems here in Montgomery,” Bentley said. “This is exactly why I implemented the state law of ‘Self-Rape’ last month and this is exactly what it is meant to be used for. I plan to do whatever I can to ensure that tragedies like this don’t happen again. We need to educate our children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation before it’s too late.”\\n\\nHorner, after hearing his charges by the Honorable Judge Stevens of the Alabama Southern District Court, broke down in tears and had to be restrained by bailiffs.\\n\\nTranscripts of the 9-1-1 call were released to the public:\\n\\n“911, what’s your emergency?”\\n“Help! My son is watching porn and masturbating! That is not allowed in this house and I don’t know what kind of demons possessed him to violate his body in such a matter. I’m so shaken up! Please send help immediately!”\\n\\n33-year-old Martha Horner, mother to the young boy, who is a self-proclaimed fanatical Baptist follower, told CNN she is still in shock.\\n\\n“Up until now, my young, precious boy had no run-ins with the law, no drugs or alcohol, was a straight-A student, was in numerous extra curricular activities and played starting center on the boys Varsity basketball team,” Horner’s mother said. “But somewhere along the way he started playing on the Devil’s playground. Hopefully because of my quick thinking and actions my son will soon be able to get the help he so badly needs. I pray for it; please Jesus, save our family!”\\n\\nMs. Horner’s controversial actions have been applauded by some, for example, Lonnie Childs, president and founder of the federally funded Christian anti-masturbation organization STOP Masturbation NOW.\\n\\n“STOP Masturbation NOW ministries have nominated Martha Horner for our coveted Mother of the Year award,” Childs told reporters. “She really stepped up, provided moral discipline and leadership under such difficult conditions. My prayer app has been activated and I send this brave, courageous woman nothing but the best during these difficult times. I encourage you all all to do the same.”\\n\\nA mascot for the Christian organization, Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, told reporters he is pleased with the justice served today and is confident this will set a precedent for all the would be masturbators out there.\\n\\n“Fappy® has helped tens of thousands of adults and children around the world learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During our visits to schools around the world, our organization has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; we have done great things. Our organization is passionate about the great work that we do. The children even have a nickname for Fappy®, they call him the tickle monster. Working side by side with such great a great man as Governor Bentley, we’re ridding the demons from these heathen’s pants, one pair of pants at a time. Fappy® vows to stay on this case until justice is served!”\\n\\nOfficer Tom Downey with the Montgomery Police Department, who took the child into custody, spoke with Montgomery Fox News station WVOC about the arrest.\\n\\n“We thought at first he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about how we should leave him alone and just let him watch his ‘girl on girl action’, as he said it, makes me sick! It’s a slippery slope my friend, one day it’s masturbating to porn, the next day it’s raping some innocent school girl. Thank God we got this heathen off the streets before another tragedy could have occurred.” Downey continued, “There is no better feeling than putting the real bad guys behind bars. Nothing better than that I tell ya.

      "‘Bird Box’ Challenge: Man Crashes After Attempting To Drive Blindfolded\\nAUSTIN, TX – A 20 year old man is being hospitalized in serious condition after being involved in an automobile accident. According to witnesses, the man was driving while blindfolded. Authorities say the man was attempting the “Bird Box challenge”, a challenge that consists of attempting every day tasks while blindfolded, in this case driving a car.\\nJacob, 20, is currently being hospitalized at Austin state hospital after being involved in a serious 4 vehicle accident. All others involved in the accident walked away with minor cuts and bruises. Jacob was attempting to drive his car down 45th street blindfolded thanks to the latest internet challenge called the “Bird Box challenge”. ‘Bird Box’ is the title of a recently released Netflix horror film in which characters in the movie must be blindfolded to not be “possessed” by the evil spirits, thus the characters had to do everyday activities blindfolded.\\n“Natural selection”, says Nurse Dennis Seyih, “this is darwinism at it’s finest hour” he finished, referring to Jacob.\\nExperts are actually encouraging people to partake in this one-of-many dangerous internet challenges that

A year and a half after the series finale, in which Cranston played cancer riddled Walter White, doctors have attributed Cranston’s career’s sickness to his minor role in 2014’s reboot of the Godzilla franchise.\\n\\n“It’s a known carcinogen,” said famed oncologist Dr Hugh Hormones. “Taking small parts in disappointing remakes of classic movies is a surefire way to precipitate the disease. We warn actors time and time again, but after starring in long-running award-winning series, the temptation of getting back out there is just too great.”\\n\\nFans of the actor have come out in huge support of his ailing career, sending sympathetic tweets and reposting photos they had taken with him – most of them show the man with a still-healthy looking career.\\n\\n“Breaking Bad was always gonna be impossible to top,” tweeted TheRealJohnJonson. “#WeLoveYouWalterWhite”\\n\\n“Bryan Cranston will forever be Walter White in my heart,” posted JessePinkmanStillLives. “#IBoughtGodzillaOnBluRay #ItWasOnSale #SupportCranston”\\n\\nHowever, it seems that Cranston may not the only member of the cast of the AMC hit to be stricken with this rampant disease. Co-star Aaron Paul is said to be undergoing tests after symptoms that his own career might be deteriorating due to the incurable illness.\\n\\n“Aaron took few precautions in exposed himself to an even more severe carcinogen,” said Dr Hormones, referring to Paul’s part in the latest reimagining of the story of Moses, Exodus: Gods and Kings. In it, Paul takes the role of Joshua, whose only lines include shouting the name “Moses” unclearly. This comes hot on the heels of his action film Need For Speed, a film about fast cars that is, curiously, not based on the video game series of the same name, and is a movie that most people aren’t even aware exists.\\n\\nFamily members of both victims have announced that they will stand by their loved ones’ sides throughout, and will “fight this thing together.”\\n\\n“Aaron and Bryan at least have each other to get through it with. Their careers have for so long been interlinked, and now they will until the end,” said a family friend of Cranston’s.\\n\\nReports, however, suggest that Paul may be exposing himself to yet another possibly fatal carcinogen, with rumors placing him in the role of the scarecrow in an as yet unannounced reboot of the Hollywood classic The Wizard of Oz.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
      "Is Aspartame Responsible for ‘An Epidemic of Multiple Sclerosis and Lupus’?\\nI have spent several days lecturing at the WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL CONFERENCE on “ASPARTAME marketed as ‘NutraSweet’, ‘Equal’, and ‘Spoonful”‘. In the keynote address by the EPA, they announced that there was an epidemic of multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus, and they did not understand what toxin was causing this to be rampant across the United States. I explained that I was there to lecture on exactly that subject.\\n\\nWhen the temperature of Aspartame exceeds 86 degrees F, the wood alcohol ASPARTAME coverts to formaldehyde and then to formic acid, which in turn causes metabolic acidosis. (Formic acid is the poison found in the sting of fire ants). The methanol toxicity mimics multiple sclerosis; thus people are being diagnosed with having multiple sclerosis in error. The multiple sclerosis is not a death sentence, where methanol toxicity is.\\n\\nIn the case of systemic lupus, we are finding it has become almost as rampant as multiple sclerosis, especially Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi drinkers. Also, with methanol toxicity, the victims usually drink three to four 12 oz. cans of them per day, some even more. In the cases of systemic lupus, which is triggered by ASPARTAME, the victim usually does not know that the aspartame is the culprit. The victim continues its use aggravating the lupus to such a degree, that sometimes it becomes life threatening.\\n\\nWhen we get people off the aspartame, those with systemic lupus usually become asymptomatic. Unfortunately, we can not reverse this disease. On the other hand, in the case of those diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, (when in reality, the disease is methanol toxicity), most of the symptoms disappear. We have seen cases where their vision has returned and even their hearing has returned. This also applies to cases of tinnitus. During a lecture I said “If you are using ASPARTAME (NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, etc.) and you suffer from fibromyalgia symptoms, spasms, shooting pains, numbness in your legs, cramps, vertigo, dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, joint pain, depression, anxiety attacks, slurred speech, blurred vision, or memory loss — you probably have ASPARTAME DISEASE!”\\n\\nPeople were jumping up during the lecture saying, “I’ve got this, is it reversible?” It is rampant. Some of the speakers at my lecture even were suffering from these symptoms. In one lecture attended by the Ambassador of Uganda, he told us that their sugar industry is adding aspartame! He continued by saying that one of the industry leader’s son could no longer walk – due in part by product usage!\\n\\nWe have a very serious problem. Even a stranger came up to Dr. Espisto (one of my speakers) and myself and said, ‘Could you tell me why so many people seem to be coming down with MS? During a visit to a hospice, a nurse said that six of her friends, who were heavy Diet Coke addicts, had all been diagnosed with MS. This is beyond coincidence.\\n\\nHere is the problem. There were Congressional Hearings when aspartame was included in 100 different products. Since this initial hearing, there\\nhave been two subsequent hearings, but to no avail. Nothing as been done. The drug and chemical lobbies have very deep pockets. Now there are over\\n5,000 products containing this chemical, and the PATENT HAS EXPIRED!!!!!\\n\\nAt the time of this first hearing, people were going blind. The methanol in the aspartame converts to formaldehyde in the retina of the eye. Formaldehyde is grouped in the same class of drugs as cyanide and arsenic DEADLY POISONS!!! Unfortunately, it just takes longer to quietly kill, but it is killing people and causing all kinds of neurological problems. Aspartame changes the brain’s chemistry. It is the reason for severe seizures. This drug changes the dopamine level in the brain. Imagine what this drug does to patients suffering from Parkinson’s Disease. This drug also causes Birth Defects.\\n\\nThere is absolutely no reason to take this product. It is NOT A DIET PRODUCT!!! The Congressional record said, “It makes you crave carbohydrates and will make you FAT”. Dr. Roberts stated that when he got patients off aspartame, their average weight loss was 19 pounds per person. The formaldehyde stores in the fat cells, particularly in the hips and thighs.\\n\\nAspartame is especially deadly for diabetics. All physicians know what wood alcohol will do to a diabetic. We find that physicians believe that they have patients with retinopathy, when in fact, it is caused by the aspartame. The aspartame keeps the blood sugar level out of control, causing many patients to go into a coma. Unfortunately, many have died. People were telling us at the Conference of the American College of Physicians, that they had relatives that switched from saccharin to an aspartame product and how that relative had eventually gone into a coma. Their physicians could not get the blood sugar levels under control. Thus, the patients suffered acute memory loss and eventually coma and death.\\n\\nMemory loss is due to the fact that aspartic acid and phenylalanine are neurotoxic without the other amino acids found in protein. Thus it goes past the blood brain barrier and deteriorates the neurons of the brain. Dr. Russell Blaylock, neurosurgeon, said, “The ingredients stimulates the neurons of the brain to death, causing brain damage of varying degrees. Dr. Blaylock has written a book entitled EXCITOTOXINS: THE TASTE THAT KILLS” (Health Press 1-800-643-2665). Dr. H.J. Roberts, diabetic specialist and world expert on aspartame poisoning, has also written a book entitled DEFENSE AGAINST ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE” (1-800-814-9800). Dr. Roberts tells how aspartame poisoning is escalating Alzheimer’s Disease, and indeed it is. As the hospice nurse told me, women are being admitted at 30 years of age with Alzheimer’s Disease. Dr. Blaylock and Dr. Roberts will be writing a position paper with some case histories and will post it on the Internet.\\n\\nAccording to the Conference of the American College of Physicians, ‘We are talking about a plague of neurological diseases caused by this deadly poison”.\\n\\nDr. Roberts realized what was happening when aspartame was first marketed. He said “his diabetic patients presented memory loss, confusion, and severe vision loss”. At the Conference of the American College of Physicians, doctors admitted that they did not know. They had wondered why seizures were rampant (the phenylalanine in aspartame breaks down the seizure threshold and depletes serotonin, which causes manic depression, panic attacks, rage and violence).\\n\\nJust before the Conference, I received a FAX from Norway, asking for a possible antidote for this poison because they are experiencing so many problems in their country. This poison is now available in 90 PLUS countries worldwide. Fortunately, we had speakers and ambassadors at the Conference from different nations who have pledged their help. We ask that you help too. Print this article out and warn everyone you know. Take anything that contains aspartame back to the store.

      "CHINA: MINER FOUND ALIVE AFTER 17 YEARS UNDERGROUND\\nWhile they were exploring the galleries, they stumbled upon Cheung Wai, a 59-year-old survivor from the 2001 accident, obviously in a rather bad shape.\\n\\nWai was immediately taken to the hospital where a complete evaluation of his physical and mental states will be done over the next weeks.\\n\\nThe poor man had remained trapped underground with the bodies of 78 of his dead coworkers after an earthquake of a magnitude of 7,8 hit the region and caused the wooden support structure of the mine to crumble and collapse.\\n\\nSomehow lucky in his misfortune, Mr. Cheung was saved by the fact that a ventilation duct still connected his underground prison to the surface, allowing him access to air that was sufficiently pure to keep him alive.\\nWai managed to survive thanks to an emergency stash of rice and water, stored in an underground depot, conceived especially for this kind of case.\\n\\nThe man complemented his diet by catching and eating the countless rats that pullulate in the mine, as well as collecting large quantities of some sort of phosphorescent moss, which constituted his only source of vitamins. \\nEven though Wai was suffering from great physical and mental stress, he managed to give proper burials to all of his comrades, spending almost a year in this great selfless act.\\n\\nMining accidents remain common in China, despite growing measures by the government to reduce the problem, which killed more than 4000 miners a year at the beginning of the millennium.\\n\\nOver the last years, the authorities have been cracking down on many unregulated mining operations which account for almost 80 percent of the country’s 16,000 mines.\\n\\nThe closure of about 1,000 dangerous small mines last year helped to cut in half the average number of miners killed, to about six a day, in the first months of this year, according to government statistics.\\n\\nThe case of Mr. Cheung remains unique, however, and constitutes a world record, according to the universally recognized authority on record-breaking achievement, Guinness.\\nThe former record for surviving underground was of 142 days and was held by a British man named Geoff Smith. He had been voluntarily buried in the backyard of the Railway Inn, his favorite pub, with the intention of breaking the record.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
      "RED SEA: ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER REMAINS OF EGYPTIAN ARMY FROM THE BIBLICAL EXODUS\\nSuez | Egypt’s Antiquities Ministry announced this morning that a team of underwater archaeologists had discovered that remains of a large Egyptian army from the 14th century BC, at the bottom of the Gulf of Suez, 1.5 kilometers offshore from the modern city of  Ras Gharib.\\nThe team was searching for the remains of ancient ships and artifacts related to Stone Age and Bronze Age trade in the Red Sea area when they stumbled upon a gigantic mass of human bones darkened by age.\\n\\nThe scientists led by Professor Abdel Muhammad Gader and associated with Cairo University’s Faculty of Archaeology, have already recovered a total of more than 400 different skeletons, as well as hundreds of weapons and pieces of armor.\\n\\nThe remains of two war chariots were also discovered scattered over an area of approximately 200 square meters.\\n\\nThey estimate that more than 5,000 other bodies could be dispersed over a wider area, suggesting that an army of large size may have perished on the site.\\n\\nThis magnificient blade from an egyptian khopesh, was certainly the weapon of an important character. It was discovered near the remains of a highly decorated war chariot, suggesting it could have belonged to a prince or nobleman.\\nMany clues on the site have brought Professor Gader and his team to conclude that the bodies could be linked to the famous episode of the Exodus.\\n\\nFirst of all, the ancient soldiers seem to have died on dry ground, since no traces of boats or ships have been found in the area.\\n\\nThe positions of the bodies and the fact that they were stuck in a vast quantity of clay and rock imply that they could have died in a mudslide or a tidal wave.\\nThe sheer number of bodies suggests that a large ancient army perished on the site, and the dramatic way by which they were killed, seem to corroborate the biblical version of the Red Sea Crossing when the army of the Egyptian Pharaoh was destroyed by the returning waters that Moses had parted.\\n\\nThis new find certainly proves that there was indeed an Egyptian army of large size that was destroyed by the waters of the Red Sea during the reign of King Akhenaten.\\n\\nThe famous biblical account of the \"Red Sea Crossing\" was dismisseded by many scholars and historians as more symbolic than historical.\\nFor centuries, the famous biblical account of the “Red Sea Crossing” was dismissed by most scholars and historians as more symbolic than historical.\\n\\n“This astounding discovery brings undeniable scientific proof that one the most famous episodes of the Old Testament was indeed based on a historical event,” Professor Gader said during the press conference.\\n“It brings a brand new perspective on a story that many historians have been considering for years as a work of fiction and suggesting that other biblical stories like the Plagues of Egypt could indeed have a historical base.\\n\\nA lot more research and many more recovery operations are to be expected on the site over the next few years, as Professor Gader and his team have already announced their desire to retrieve the rest of the bodies and artefacts from was has turned out to be one of the richest archaeological underwater sites ever discovered.\\n

      "Dell Keyboard Loggers\\nI was opening up my almost brand new Dell 600m laptop, to replace a broken PCMCIA slot riser on the motherboard. As soon as I got the keyboard off, I noticed a small cable running from the keyboard connection underneath a piece of metal protecting the motherboard.\\nI figured “No Big Deal”, and continued with the dissasembly. But when I got the metal panels off, I saw a small white heatshink-wrapped package. Being ever-curious, I sliced the heatshrink open. I found a little circuit board inside. Being an EE by trade, this piqued my curiosity considerably. On one side of the board, one Atmel AT45D041A four megabit Flash memory chip. On the other side, one Microchip Technology PIC16F876 Programmable Interrupt Controller, along with a little Fairchild Semiconductor CD4066BCM quad bilateral switch.\\n\\nLooking further, I saw that the other end of the cable was connected to the integrated ethernet board.\\n\\nWhat could this mean? I called Dell tech support about it, and they said, and I quote, “The intregrated service tag identifier is there for assisting customers in the event of lost or misplaced personal information.” He then hung up. A little more research, and I found that that board spliced in between the keyboard and the ethernet chip is little more than a Keyghost hardware keylogger.\\n

      "Russia Warns Obama: Global War Over “Bee Apocalypse” Coming Soon\\nThe shocking minutes relating to President Putin’s meeting this past week with US Secretary of State John Kerry reveal the Russian leaders “extreme outrage” over the Obama regimes continued protection of global seed and plant bio-genetic giants Syngenta and Monsanto in the face of a growing “bee apocalypse” that the Kremlin warns “will most certainly” lead to world war.\\nAccording to these minutes, released in the Kremlin today by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation (MNRE), Putin was so incensed over the Obama regime’s refusal to discuss this grave matter that he refused for three hours to even meet with Kerry, who had traveled to Moscow on a scheduled diplomatic mission, but then relented so as to not cause an even greater rift between these two nations.The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RS) today has issued an “Extreme Danger” warning for all vessels entering or nearing the United States Port of Mobile, located in the State of Alabama, as the death toll rises from what this report claims is an environmental disaster related to the flowering of genetically modified cotton crops located in this region.\\nAccording to this report, RS officials became “highly concerned” this past week after the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) reported that at least 2 people have died, and another 5 put in hospital, due to a “mysterious illness” attacking the respiratory systems of those affected and causing flu-like symptoms.\\n

      "John Cena Accidentally Says “You Can’t See Me” To A Blind Kid\\nDuring one of his many meet-and-greet sessions at children’s hospitals across the nation, John Cena made an embarrassing gaffe by saying “You can’t see me” to a little blind boy.\\nCena waved his right hand in front of his face, flashed a friendly smile and said “You can’t see me” to 11-year-old Timothy Greene, who suffers from a degenerative neurological disorder that affects his optic nerves.\\nAn awkward hush fell over the lounge in Manhattan Pediatric Hospital, where several children and their parents were gathered for the much-anticipated meeting with Cena.\\nA WWE public relations associate then whispered to Cena that Timothy is legally blind, which caused Cena to turn pale and stammer something about “hustle, loyalty and respect.”\\nTimothy later said he wasn’t bothered by Cena’s comment, and insisted he found the whole thing kind of funny.\\n“Cena sucks anyway,” he said. “I’m a CM Punk fan.”\\n\\n

      "Doctors Admit “Crystal Meth Is\\nActually Good For You”\\nDoctors have today admitted that they have been wrong about crystal meth this whole time and that the powerful narcotic is actually amazingly beneficial for health and well being.\\n“It increases concentration and drive, providing a much needed energy boost for the carrying out of petty crimes and handbag robberies,” confirmed Department of Health spokesperson Dr. William Gould. “A strict diet of crystal meth is shown to improve brain function making it easier to count coins collected on the street by begging with a coffee cup.”\\nDr. Gould claimed that crystal meth contains “zero saturated fats and is perfect for people who are on a low carb diet” while also providing “100% of your daily methamphetamine needs”.\\n“A strict crystal meth diet also helps people shed unwanted pounds, hair and teeth and promotes the growth of healthy scabs and unclean fingernails,” continued the report which assessed the health of 1000 meth addicts and concluded that they had the rugged lean health of a 19th century street urchin with taut, tense muscles from constant alertness coupled with an immunity to most infections from living in their own filth for long periods at a time.\\n“It’s absolutely fantastic as an appetite suppressant, often meth users will simply forget about having to eat which will eliminate a flabby stomach and give the face a beautiful sunken emaciated look,” continued Dr. Gould who recommended that crystal meth should be enjoyed as part of a healthy diet that involves plenty of alcohol, cigarettes and unprotected sex.\\n“If people follow the crystal meth diet then they can expect to see results ranging from a reduction in unwanted bone density, a decrease in harmful bowel movements and removal of unwanted restorative sleep, within mere days of trying the super drug.”\\nCrystal is available from all good health food outlets, dodgy blokes on motorcycles and Silk Road.\\n\\n

      "Military to Pledge Oath To Obama, Not Constitution\\nSecretary of Defense Robert Gates is extremely frustrated with orders that the White House is contemplating. According to sources at the Pentagon, including all branches of the armed forces, the Obama Administration may break with a centuries-old tradition.\\n\\nA spokesman for General James Cartwright, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, states that the Obama Administration wants to have soldiers and officers pledge a loyalty oath directly to the office of the President, and no longer to the Constitution.\\n\\n\"The oath to the Constitution is as old as the document itself.\" the spokesman said, \"At no time in American history, not even in the Civil War, did the oath change or the subject of the oath differ. It has always been to the Constitution.\"\\n\\nThe back-and-forth between the White House and the Defense Department was expected as President George W. Bush left office. President Obama has already signed orders to close Guantanamo and to pull combat troops from Iraq. But, this, say many at the Defense Department, goes too far.\\n\\n\"Technically, we can't talk about it before it becomes official policy.\" the spokesman continued. \"However, the Defense Department, including the Secretary, will not take this laying down. Expect a fight from the bureaucracy and the brass.\"\\n\\nSources at the White House had a different point of view. In a circular distributed by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, the rationale for the change was made more clear.\\n\\n\"The President feels that the military has been too indoctrinated by the old harbingers of hate: nationalism, racism, and classism. By removing an oath to the American society, the soldiers are less likely to commit atrocities like those at Abu Ghraib.\"\\n\\n\"We expect a lot of flak over this,\" the classified memo continues. \"But those that would be most against it are those looking either for attention or control.\"\\n\\nThe time frame for the changes are unknown. However, it is more likely that the changes will be made around the July 4th holiday, in order to dampen any potential backlash. The difference in the oath will actually only be slight. The main differences will be the new phrasing. It is expected that the oath to the Constitution will be entirely phased out within two years.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

      "Obama’s Troubling Internet Fund-Raising\\nWHERE IS THE MONEY COMING FROM ?\\n\\nBy MAUREEN DOWD\\nPublished: June 29, 2008\\n\\nOBAMA’S TROUBLING INTERNET FUND RAISING\\n\\nCertainly the most interesting and potentially devastating phone call I have received during this election cycle came this week from one of the Obama’s campaign internet geeks. These are the staffers who devised Obama’s internet fund raising campaign which raised in the neighborhood of $200 million so far. That is more then twice the total funds raised by any candidate in history — and this was all from the internet campaign.\\n\\nWhat I learned from this insider was shocking but I guess we shouldn’t be surprised that when it comes to fund raising there simply are no rules that can’t be broken and no ethics that prevail.\\n\\nObama’s internet campaign started out innocently enough with basic e-mail networking, lists saved from previous party campaigns and from\\n\\nsupporters who visited any of the Obama campaign web sites. Small contributions came in from these sources and the internet campaign staff were more than pleased by the results.\\n\\nThen, about two months into the campaign the daily contribution intake multiplied. Where was it coming from? One of the web site security monitors began to notice the bulk of the contributions were clearly coming in from overseas internet service providers and at the rate and frequency of transmission it was clear these donations were “programmed” by a very sophisticated user.\\n\\nWhile the security people were not able to track most of the sources due to firewalls and other blocking devices put on these contributions they were able to collate the number of contributions that were coming in seemingly from individuals but the funds were from only a few credit card accounts and bank electronic funds transfers. The internet service providers (ISP) they were able to trace were from Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other Middle Eastern countries. One of the banks used for fund transfers was also located in Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nAnother concentrated group of donations was traced to a Chinese ISP with a similar pattern of limited credit card charges.\\n\\nIt became clear that these donations were very likely coming from sources other than American voters. This was discussed at length within the campaign and the decision was made that none of these donations violated campaign financing laws.\\n\\nIt was also decided that it was not the responsibility of the campaign to audit these millions of contributions as to the actual source (specific credit card number or bank transfer account numbers) to insure that none of these internet contributors exceeded the legal maximum donation on a cumulative basis of many small donations. They also found the record keeping was not complete enough to do it anyway.\\n\\nThis is a shocking revelation.\\n\\nWe have been concerned about the legality of “bundling” contributions after the recent exposure of illegal bundlers but now it appears we may have an even greater problem.\\n\\nI guess we should have been somewhat suspicious when the numbers started to come out. We were told (no proof offered) that the Obama internet contributions were from $10.00 to $25.00 or so.\\n\\nIf the $200,000,000 is right, and the average contribution was $15.00, that would mean over 13 million individuals made contributions? That would also be 13 million contributions would need to be processed. How did all that happen?\\n\\nI believe the Obama campaign’s internet fund raising needs a serious, in depth investigation and audit.

      "New Research Suggest That Men Who Cheat On Their Spouse Are More Honest And Emotional\\nThis, of course, begs the question: Why? Why do men really cheat? And why do they sometimes continue cheating after they’re caught, even in the face of profoundly unwanted consequences like divorce, loss of parental contact, loss of social standing, and the like?\\nThe truth is that all sorts of dynamics can play into a man’s decision to engage in infidelity. Generally, though, his choice to cheat is driven by one or more of the following factors:\\nLove: Most men cheat because they just love so much they can’t control themselves and sometimes this leads to cheating but he cheats because he a lover.\\nHonesty: Sometime a man is so honest with another woman it might lead to a sexual encounter with another female.\\nEmotional: Men try not to show their emotions but like anyone sometimes they need a shoulder to cry on and this may lead to accidental cheating\\nAccidental: Most men don’t cheat purposely sometimes is accidental forgiving your man for accidentally cheating can help you build a better relationship with your partner.\\nIt’s Your Fault: Most men don’t cheat because they are tempted but pushed by their spouse to cheat you have to look in the mirror and ask yourself what are you doing wrong\\n\\n

      "29 Humans Killed in Laboratory\\nProducing Militarized Artificial\\nIntelligence Robots\\nJAPAN – 29 scientist were killed by militarized artificial intelligence robots.\\nJapan begun working on creating AI militarized robots back in 2006 Japan\\ndenied the programs existence but the proof is inevitable.\\n\\nDexter who runs the laboratory managed to escape the fiasco told the story\\nof the accident. Japanese military opened fire on these militarized robots\\nwhile scientist shut them down but one ran and begun to fix itself\\ndownloading files to repair itself via orbit satellite. This was kept secret until\\na whistle blower confirmed the incident. As of now Dexter’s laboratory is still\\na secret to his family except for Dee-Dee who is always messing around in\\nthere.\\n\\nAI will inevitably become a necessity to business just as computers are\\ntoday.

      "Jaden Smith Says He is a Prophet and God Inspired his New Fashion Line 666\\nJaden Smith, the son of rapper-actor legend Will Smith, has announced a new fashion line, which he titled “666.” Despite 666 being highly regarded as an evil number which references the mark of the beast, Jaden says the fashion line was inspired by God.\\n\\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Jaden spoke about his fashion line:\\n\\n“God exists in all things that surround the fire that burns in the sky. She is responsible for all spontaneous ideas. In fact, 666 is not an evil number. This number is actually three part and represents the six angels that descended from the six Heavens, who are searching for the six prophets who are meant to lead the masses. Each prophet will be the exalted leader of that heaven. I have been chosen by one of those angels as one of those prophets. This line is not just clothing. Clothing is meant to cover, while 666 is meant to transform. To wear these clothes is to seek protection from the ills of the world and to pledge allegiance to my Heaven.”\\n\\nJaden revealed the line will feature non-traditional clothing for men to include tunics, dresses, long shirts, leather, and more.Jaden, along with his sister Willow, have become synonymous with off-the-wall thinking. Late last year the brother and sister spoke about prana energy and why schooling was overrated.\\nWhen asked about their experience with time, Willow and Jaden stated:\\n\\nWILLOW: I mean, time for me, I can make it go slow or fast, however I please, and that’s how I know it doesn’t exist.\\n\\nJADEN: It’s proven that how time moves for you depends on where you are in the universe. It’s relative to beings and other places. But on the level of being here on earth, if you are aware in a moment, one second can last a year. And if you are unaware, your whole childhood, your whole life can pass by in six seconds. But it’s also such a thing that you can get lost in.\\n\\nWILLOW: Because living.JADEN: Right, because you have to live.

      "I have only heard the story behind this picture...\\nI have only heard the story behind this picture once, but it literally brought tears to my eyes. On September 11, 2001, a hijacked plane knifed into the side of the Pentagon. We all know that. What very few people have heard is shortly afterwards, the director of a nursery in the building stood looking at the children in her charge, wondering how to move all of the babies and toddlers to safety.\\n\\nA marine rushed into the room and asked if she was alright. She needed help and she told him that. He turned and ran out; the woman assumed that he had gone away for good. As she formulated a plan of action, she heard footsteps in the hall.\\n\\nThe man had returned—this time, though, he was not alone. At least forty other Marines followed him. They picked up the babies in their cribs, the toddlers, the helpless infants. They carried them through the halls and to a nearby park, where they arranged the cribs in a circle and set the toddlers in the middle. Then they stood guard outside, never allowing the children to be unattended.\\n\\nWhen I first saw this picture, I thought that the man carrying the children was their father. Now I realize that he was not related to them by blood, but by nationality. He is an American. They are American children. He is not their father, he is their protector. He’s a United States Marine.\\n\\n#USMC #USA\\n

      "Change at the White House\\nFor a long time, we have noticed that the decor at the White House has changed since BHO moved in. \\n\\nThe Oval Office is now stripped of the traditional red, white, and blue, and replaced with middle eastern wallpaper, drapes, and decor. \\nThe hallway that he walks out of to talk to the press now has middle eastern chairs, drapes, etc. And the thing that has bothered me the most is the bright yellow drape behind him every time he speaks from the white house. \\n\\nIt has Arabic symbols on it and has been there from the beginning. \\n\\nToday I received this and it clearly shows what I have been noticing. That bright yellow curtain is highly visible, but as you scroll down, you will see what is predominantly absent. Also, as you look at the pictures of other presidents speaking from the same spot, look at the traditional 'American' background and decor as opposed to the new decor. Trust me when I say that this is intentional. It should alarm every American.\\n\\nWhat is missing at Barack Hussein Obama's press conference? \\n\\nNo it is not the teleprompters. See the other president's pics for a clue.\\n\\nBARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA (aka Barry \"The Kenyan\" Soetoro)\\n\\nThat's right ... no American flags!\\n\\nAnd I don't believe it was just an accident! It is intentional. So I ask, why is it intentional? He told you he would change America, didn't he? This man, whoever he really is, is not an American. He and his ilk want to end the American Free Enterprise System.\\n\\nHow do you like Socialism now?\\n\\nVote in November like your way of life depends on it! Because it does!\\n\\n

      "Hobby Lobby Stones Gay Employee to Death\\nManagers at a Hobby Lobby store in Arkansas stoned to death an employee today for being gay.\\n\\nAccording to a report in the Ozark Post-Gazette, the store’s management decided to execute Jeremy Gleason, 43, in an alley behind the store in accordance with the Biblical verseLeviticus 20:13, which commands believers to kill homosexual men.\\n\\nThe assailants reportedly tied Gleason to a pole and threw large chunks of granite and whole bricks at his body. An autopsy later revealed the adoptive father of 2 young children died of blunt force trauma to the head.\\n\\nAlthough Gleason’s family have called for Hobby Lobby’s managers to be charged with murder, police say they do not intend to make any arrests in the case because the store was simply exercising its religious beliefs.\\n\\n“I don’t really see the problem here,” says Mark Patterson, Wilson County sheriff, “I mean stoning gays to death is in the Bible. And Hobby Lobby is a Christian company.\\n\\n“What am I supposed to do? Arrest the people who killed him? Last I checked this was America. We don’t put people in jail for exercising their religion.”\\n\\nGleason’s unusual execution comes just days after the US Supreme Court ruled that his employer may be exempted from a federal law requiring employers to provide contraceptive coverage to their employees.\\n

      "Fox News Classified Satire By FCC\\nThere has been an ongoing dispute about the legitimacy of the content put out by Fox News. Between the amount of complaints and discredited stories by varying myth-busting sources, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has now reclassified Fox News from a valid news source to that of satire.\\n\\nThe FCC cannot classify Fox News as purely entertainment-based fiction because their stories contain the names, places and actions of legitimacy. This decision to classify Fox News as satire did not come easily, because many see the news network as well-founded and they should have the freedom of speech to report as they so choose.\\n\\nA statement put out by the FCC says, “The decision to classify Fox News as satire has come after several years of evaluation regarding the sources of their reporting and the bias of their programming. While much of their content is based on legitimate news, it is spun is a way that cannot not be deemed newsworthy to the viewing public. If Fox News so chooses to report actual news stories of legitimacy without skewing the content we may overturn our decision and reclassify the network to a valid news source once again.”\\n\\nIt seems the FCC is leaving the decision to be an actual news source up to the programming directors and others in charge at News Corp. Both Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes have not been able to be reached for comment.\\n\\nAs far as programming, it will be business as usual, but there will now be a running disclaimer along the bottom of the viewing screen that states, “This is not a valid news source.”\\n

      "POPE FRANCIS CONDEMNS RACISM AND DECLARES THAT “ALL RELIGIONS ARE TRUE” AT HISTORIC THIRD VATICAN COUNCIL\\nFor the last six months, Catholic cardinals, bishops and theologians have been deliberating in Vatican City, discussing the future of the church and redefining long-held Catholic doctrines and dogmas. The Third Vatican Council, is undoubtedly the largest and most important since the Second Vatican Council was concluded in 1962. Pope Francis convened the new council to “finally finish the work of the Second Vatican Council.” While some traditionalists and conservative reactionaries on the far right have decried these efforts, they have delighted progressives around the world.\\nTo a chorus of thunderous applause, Pope Francis stated “because Muslims, Hindus and African Animists are also made in the very likeness and image of God, to hate them is to hate God! To reject them to is to reject God and the Gospel of Christ. Whether we worship at a church, a synagogue, a mosque or a mandir, it does not matter. Whether we call God, Jesus, Adonai, Allah or Krishna, we all worship the same God of love. This truth is self-evident to all who have love and humility in their hearts!”\\n\\nIn a speech that shocked many, the Pope claimed “All religions are true, because they are true in the hearts of all those who believe in them. What other kind of truth is there? In the past, the church has been harsh on those it deemed morally wrong or sinful. Today, we no longer judge. Like a loving father, we never condemn our children. Our church is big enough for heterosexuals and homosexuals, for the pro-life and the pro-choice! For conservatives and liberals, even communists are welcome and have joined us. We all love and worship the same God.”\\n

      "World Gun Violence Has Been Reportedly Declining Since Apple’s Gun Emoji Change In 2016\\nWORLDWIDE – According to world health reports, worldwide gun violence has been steadily declining since Apple replaced the gun emoji with a water gun back in August 2016 for ios 10.\\nAccording to researchers, there was a steady increase in worldwide gun violence since the 1970s, peaking at 251,000,000 in 2015. However in 2016, with the change of Apples gun emoji to a water gun, worldwide gun violence has been on an unprecedented decline, with only 900 gun related crimes in 2017, and an all time low of only 5 gun related crimes so far in 2018. Gun violence has almost disappeared completely thanks to Apple.\\n“Thank God for apple”, says Tom Gill of the American Medical Association, “who would’ve known that the key to a better world was just an emoji change away”.\\nResearchers predict that 2019 will have only 1 gun related crime, with the offender praised rather than punished, for completing the achievement of being the only human on earth to commit a gun related crime that year.\\n\\n

If Barack Obama would apply for a job with the FBI or with the Secret Service, he would be disqualified because of his past associations with William Ayers, a known (and unrepentant) terrorist. If elected President, he would not qualify to be his own body guard! Ayers was a founder in 1969 of the violent antiwar group the Weathermen, which took responsibility for at least 12 bombings between 1970 and 1974. A pipe bomb attributed to the group killed a police officer and severely injured another in 1970, and three of the group's own members were killed in a 1970 explosion in a Greenwich Village townhouse in which they were making bombs. Ayers was investigated in connection with the group's activities, but the charges were dropped in 1974 due to prosecutorial misconduct. He emerged from hiding, earned a doctorate in education from Columbia University, and is now a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Like Obama, he lives on the South Side of Chicago.\\n\\nObama and Ayers are both active in politics and civic life in the city. They both volunteered at two different charities, the Woods Foundation and the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, and Ayers hosted a small gathering for Obama and then-state Sen. Alice Palmer in 1995 as Obama planned to run for the seat Palmer was vacating.\\n

      "Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was made to disappear so one party could gain control of a multiply-owned patent.\\n\\n\\nHere’s what you all need to know. Spread this information everywhere:\\n\\nFour days after the missing flight MH370 a patent is approved by the Patent Office\\n\\n4 of the 5 Patent holders are Chinese employees of Freescale Semiconductor of Austin TX.\\n\\nPatent is divided up on 20% increments to 5 holders:\\n\\nPeidong Wang, Suzhou, China, (20%)\\nZhijun Chen, Suzhou, China, (20%)\\nZhihong Cheng, Suzhou, China, (20%)\\nLi Ying, Suzhou, China, (20%)\\nFreescale Semiconductor (20%)\\n\\nIf a patent holder dies, then the remaining holders equally share the dividends of the deceased if not disputed in a will.\\n\\nIf 4 of the 5 dies, then the remaining 1 Patent holder gets 100% of the wealth of the patent.\\n\\nThat remaining live Patent holder is Freescale Semiconductor.\\n\\nWho owns Freescale Semiconductor?\\n\\nJacob Rothschild through Blackstone (what an interesting name for a company) who owns Freescale.\\n\\nHere is your motive for the missing plane. As all 4 Chinese members of the Patent were passengers on the missing plane, and that patent was the breakthrough. We have entered the future proper, and four men was just murdered so that the last, still living member can keep this for himself to either hide or profit from.\\n

      "NRA President Jim Porter: “It’s Only A Matter Of Time Before We Can Own Colored People Again”\\nHOUSTON — It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.\\n\\n“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”\\n\\nWhen asked to clarify Porter said,\\n\\n“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”\\n\\nSeveral at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”\\n\\nIt’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments. Free Wood Post will keep you up to date as this story unfolds.\\n

      "Michele Bachmann Wants to Ban Halloween?\\nMichele Bachmann, Republican Congressional Representative to Minnesota and founder of the Tea Party Caucus, is at it again. She is calling for a ban on Halloween, stating, “This holiday is based in Satanism. It’s a Pagan ritual to worship Satan and call him forth to the earth and the liberal elites have added socialism to it. We are in the end days and we must purify our nation if we are to be welcomed into the kingdom of God.”\\n“We have to ban Halloween to save the children. That’s how they indoctrinate them you know. Giving them Satan’s candy sacks. Soon you’ve got a country full of children sucking on Satan’s sacks and thinking liberal thoughts instead of good Christian ones.”\\n

      "Florida’s “Neck Guy” Arrested\\nAgain Undergoes Plastic\\nSurgery To Decrease Neck Size\\nAnd Removes Tattoos; His\\nMugshot Had To Be Updated\\nFLORIDA – After Charles Dion Mcdowell was arrested for drug charges earlier this week, he has become an internet sensation for his abnormally sized neck, drawing jokes by thousands of social media users. According to reports, Charles could not handle the jokes and decided to surgically decrease the size of his neck with the permission of a judge.\\nAccording to reports, Charles Dion Mcdowell reportedly begged the judge to allow him to undergo plastic surgery to make his neck “normal”, the judge reportedly felt “so bad” for Charles that permission was granted. “How could i say no” said Judge John Joyce, “the man looked like Bane from Batman”.\\nCharles Dion Mcdowell emerged a new man, with his neck drastically smaller than before. Florida police retook his mugshot as his appearance underwent a noticeable change. Charles then got what remained of his neck tattoo removed, as a large portion of it was removed during surgery along with neck tissue and skin.\\nCharles is currently out on bond but a new mugshot had to be taken to update police records.\\n\\n

you are the first suspect— So cut the tough talk,”.\\nKanye even went as far as saying Drake wouldn’t even be where he is today without him.\\n“I’m the guy with the pink polo that made a way for him,” Kanye wrote. “There would never be a drake without a Kanye west so never come out your mouth with a threat.”\\nKanye’s phone must’ve died from tweeting so much that he took Kim Kardashians phone and tweeted pretending to be her but she later tweeted “DAMN NOW I GOTTA CHANGE MY PASSWORD AGAIN” giving us the assumption that it was Kanye West was tweeting and not Kim herself.\\n\\n

      "How lucky can you get! Incredible story of how man survives being hit by lightning TWICE in remarkable CCTV footage\\n\\nThe chances of being struck by lightning once are high enough.\\n\\nBut one unfortunate man appears to have been electrocuted twice within the space of a minute by two almighty bolts of lightning.\\n\\nThe hapless pedestrian had been jogging along a quiet city street when CCTV captured the astonishing moment on April 11.\\n\\nShortly before the apparent freak accident a walker carrying an umbrella and a jogger had passed through the street unscathed.\\n\\nThey are followed later by a young couple walking arm-in-arm as they shelter from what could be light drizzle.\\n\\nBut the unlucky man then jogs in from the bottom of the screen wearing dark trousers and a heavy coat.\\n\\nSeconds later a frightening bolt of electricity rips down from the heavens and zaps the man in his tracks.\\n\\nHe stumbles for a few feet before collapsing painfully face down onto the hard ground.\\n\\nAround his motionless body a dark shadow forms, which could be blood or scorched tarmac.\\n\\nAfter some 15 seconds the man begins to move his legs before struggling up from the ground. He clutches his head and sits for a moment to catch his breath.\\n\\nThe stunned jogger lifts himself up and goes on his way, resuming a brisk jog.\\n\\nBut seconds later after around ten yards a second bolt of powerful lightning strikes the man, knocking him to the ground again. Another dark shadow forms on the ground.\\n\\nThankfully, the man pulls himself to his feet and struggles away, even if he is a little confused by what just happened.\\n\\nThe astonishing video has become an internet sensation with thousands of people expressing their surprise that the unlucky man survived.\\n\\nThe chances of being struck by lighting once in a give year are around one in 700,000. The chance of being struck twice within such a short space of time are virtually unmeasurable.\\n\\nIt is not known where the video was recorded, although there is Chinese writing in the top corner of the screen.\\n\\nCynics suggested that so high was the probability of such a freak accident that the video might have been faked. \\n\\nSome internet users pointed to the lack of visible rain in the CCTV footage while one suggested that lightening hitting the ground would have caused the camera to shake.\\n\\nAnother stated that in the video the lightning lasted for only one frame, whereas, they said, real lightning would have 'overexposed the camera for at least a few frames on each strike'.\\n\\nBut other viewers said the video was genuine.\\n\\nOne wrote: 'Security cameras don't just shake every time it's windy don't they? Pause the video when the dude gets hit and look at the light, that's pretty hard to fake, don't you think?'\\n\\nAnother added: 'Photoshop can't make a thunder like that. Real.'\\n\\nAnd one person wrote: 'I think this is the lesson for all of us - if you are hit by lightning don't get up because you will feel a second wave.'\\n\\nOnly around ten per cent of people who are struck by lightning die, usually because the bolt of electricity causes their heart and breathing to stop.\\n\\nThose who survive tend to wake up from the shock within a few seconds but have little recollection of what happened before the injury. They could suffer minor burns and stroke-like symptoms.

Rumors of Nelson’s death first circulated early July 21, 2015 on social media outlets but was later confirmed by police.\\n\\nA groundskeeper scheduled to perform yard maintenance on Nelson’s property reportedly found the singer/songwriter unresponsive on the front lawn and immediately called 911.\\n\\n“There was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play,” said Det. Aldeson.\\n\\n“Determining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,” said County Coroner Frank Shultz. “It’s just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.”\\n\\nThe shocking news comes just days after a recent “60 Minutes” interview where Nelson was quoted as saying “Life is good and I have never felt better or been happier.”\\n\\nThis story is still developing and all

      "POPE FRANCIS CONDEMNS RACISM AND DECLARES THAT “ALL RELIGIONS ARE TRUE” AT HISTORIC THIRD VATICAN COUNCIL\\nFor the last six months, Catholic cardinals, bishops and theologians have been deliberating in Vatican City, discussing the future of the church and redefining long-held Catholic doctrines and dogmas. The Third Vatican Council, is undoubtedly the largest and most important since the Second Vatican Council was concluded in 1962. Pope Francis convened the new council to “finally finish the work of the Second Vatican Council.” While some traditionalists and conservative reactionaries on the far right have decried these efforts, they have delighted progressives around the world.\\n\\nThe Third Vatican Council concluded today with Pope Francis announcing that Catholicism is now a “modern and reasonable religion, which has undergone evolutionary changes. The time has come to abandon all intolerance. We must recognize that religious truth evolves and changes. Truth is not absolute or set in stone. Even atheists acknowledge the divine. Through acts of love and charity the atheist acknowledges God as well, and redeems his own soul, becoming an active participant in the redemption of humanity.\\n

      "Have Residents of Clint, Texas, been forcibly implanted with microchips by Jade Helm operatives?\\nPeople in the town of Clint, Texas are reporting that American soldiers have rounded up hundreds of civilians and forced them to submit to RFID implantation.\\n\\nCurrently Jade Helm 15 is operating just miles outside of Clint, Texas, leaving many to wonder if the two are related.\\n\\nJade Helm has been steeped in controversy since it was first announced by the military on March 23 2015, and concerned Texans have been on high alert for a potential gun-grab, or martial law scenario ever since. The governor of Texas has even deployed the National Guard to defend against any potential hostile takeover attempts. The US government has described Jade Helm as a military training exercise which focuses on specific terrains, but folks remain skeptical, and with good reason.\\n\\nSeveral eye witness reports state that residents in the small town were rounded up and brought to an abandoned shopping mall in the area. There they were given the choice between RFID implantation, or imprisonment in the makeshift military base.\\n

      "First Lady Michelle Obama to Propose National Hug a Muslim Day\\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama will unveil a proposal Monday that she hopes will ease tensions and work to counteract an ever growing Islamophobia gripping the nation. In an effort to strengthen relations and help build mutual trust with our two million Muslim Americans citizens, Michelle Obama is set to propose national “Hug a Muslim Day”.\\nThe proposed new federal holiday would eliminate and replace Columbus Day, first observed as a state holiday in 1906, and became federal in 1937. From now on, every second Monday in October would be recognized and observed as national, “Hug a Muslim Day.”\\n\\nThe proposed new federal holiday is already drawing mixed reactions from Americans,

      "Study: Fox News viewers have an IQ 20 points lower than the U.S. National average.\\n\\nThe results of a 4 year study show that Americans who obtain their news from Fox News channel have an average IQ of 80, which represents a 20 point deficit when compared to the U.S. national average of 100. IQ, or intelligence quotient, is the international standard of assessing intelligence.\\n\\nResearchers at The Intelligence Institute, a conservative non-profit group, tested 5,000 people using a series of tests that measure everything from cognitive aptitude to common sense and found that people who identified themselves as Fox News viewers and 'conservative' had, on average, significantly lower intelligent quotients. Fox Viewers represented 2,650 members of the test group\\n-----\\nTest subjects who received their news from other outlets or reported they do not watch the news scored an average IQ of 104, compared to 80 for Fox News viewers. \\n\\nLead researcher, P. Nichols, explains, \"Less intelligent animals rely on instinct when confronted by something which they do not understand. This is an ancient survival reaction all animals, including humans, exhibit. It's a very simple phenomenon, really; think about a dog being afraid of a vacuum cleaner. He doesn't know what a vacuum is or if it may harm him, so he becomes agitated and barks at it. Less intelligent humans do the same thing. Concepts that are too complex for them to understand, may frighten or anger them.\" \\n\\nHe continues, \"Fox News' content is presented at an elementary school level and plays directly into the fears of the less educated and less intelligent.\"\\n\\nRead more: http://www.city-data.com/forum/politics-other-controversies/1748756-study-fox-news-viewers-have-iq.html#ixzz5csAmy1yL\\n

      "TACO BELL MEAT\\nMONTGOMERY, AL – After allegations of false advertising, further investigation causes Taco Bell to close its doors for good.\\n\\nTaco Bell, the pseudo Mexican restaurant popular among college students, poor people, those without taste buds, and individuals with bad taste in general,  has recently been put on the stand for allegations regarding false advertisement.\\n\\nOn Friday, the law firm of Beasley, Allen, Crow, Methvin, Portis, Miles and another partner whose name no one can spell or pronounce, filed a law suit against the Mexican wannabe claiming that the meat mixture contains too many fillers and binders to be labeled as beef.\\n\\nThe majority of the time the meat mix is doused with so much cheese, salsa, and sour cream it is a wonder that anyone could tell it was beef flavored, much less question the authenticity of the meat itself.\\n\\nWeekly Would News knew that these allegations could only be just the tip of the iceberg so we sent our crack team of reporters to the streets to find out what else could be behind these allegations.\\n\\nIt did not take long for our team to discover that the meat that Taco Bell uses for its beef based products is imported from China. This set off a myriad of bells and whistles on our end so we asked our Japanese WWN affiliates to check out the Kuang Ren factory in the Zhejiang province where the beef is packaged. Within hours our Japanese colleagues were back in touch with a shocking discovery, the so called beef is actually cat and dog meat.\\n\\nWe all know that that the Chinese have been known to eat cat and dog meat but we never thought that they would have the cajones to import the goods to the US. Taco Bell would not return our phone calls, which leads us to believe that this must be true.\\n\\nUpon the discovery of the news, we immediately did the right thing and informed the FDA. The FDA has since mandated that all Taco Bells must be closed forever. So go get as many doggy burritos and kitty fajitas as you can before they are gone for good.\\n

      "14-Year-Old Girl Pregnant with Baby Jesus\\nROCKLAND — 14-year-old Amanda Peters hid her pregnancy from her mother for nearly three months until she began to show. When her mother Judy confronted her, Amanda denied having sexual intercourse and was taken immediately to a doctor who concluded she had likely been sexually active.\\n\\nThat’s when Amanda’s mother begged God to forgive her sinful daughter. However, her prayers were met strangely:  Judy claims God came to her in a vision and said he had impregnated Amanda through immaculate conception and that she was to give birth to Jesus.\\n\\n“At first I was confused, ” Mrs. Peters said. “Jesus was born to the Virgin Mary thousands of years ago, why was Amanda going to give birth to him again? But God explained this was how Jesus was to return to Earth as promised.”\\n\\nJudy told her daughter who was overjoyed that she was no longer grounded and had regained her phone privileges.\\n\\n“Things are the double bomb right now,” Amanda said. “My mom’s totally supportive and buying me lots of cool stuff I want and said she is going to pay for everything Jesus needs.”\\n\\n“I was so sick with grief over Amanda having sex,” Judy said. “And I’m now so happily relieved to know she’s still a virgin and this was all God’s doing. I can’t believe I’m going to be Jesus’ grandma… actually, I don’t know how that will work, but I’m just extremely happy my daughter isn’t having premarital sex and Jesus is coming back in less than a month.”\\n

      "Mom Calls 911 On Masturbating Teenage Son; Boy Arrested, Charged With New ‘Self-Rape’ Alabama State Law\\nAn Alabama teenager is being charged and held without bail, facing 3-15 years in prison over a new ‘Self-Rape’ state law implemented by AL Gov. Robert J. Bentley last month.\\n\\nMontgomery, AL — An Alabama boy is behind bars tonight after his mother called 9-1-1 when she found her son in his room, watching pornography and masturbating. Montgomery Police were quick to respond, arresting 15-year-old Paul Horner, who attends Jefferson Davis High School. The teenager is being held without bail and charged by prosecutors under a new controversial Alabama state law called ‘Self-Rape’, which carries a minimum of 3 years in prison with a maximum of 15 years behind bars depending on that individuals past criminal history.\\n\\nThis is the first time this new state law has been used since it was put into action last month by Alabama Governor Robert J. Bentley. Bently spoke with local news station WSFA 12 News about the charges against the boy.\\n\\n“I applaud the Alabama District court systems here in Montgomery,” Bentley said. “This is exactly why I implemented the state law of ‘Self-Rape’ last month and this is exactly what it is meant to be used for. I plan to do whatever I can to ensure that tragedies like this don’t happen again. We need to educate our children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation before it’s too late.”\\n\\nHorner, after hearing his charges by the Honorable Judge Stevens of the Alabama Southern District Court, broke down in tears and had to be restrained by bailiffs.\\n\\nTranscripts of the 9-1-1 call were released to the public:\\n\\n“911, what’s your emergency?”\\n“Help! My son is watching porn and masturbating! That is not allowed in this house and I don’t know what kind of demons possessed him to violate his body in such a matter. I’m so shaken up! Please send help immediately!”\\n\\n33-year-old Martha Horner, mother to the young boy, who is a self-proclaimed fanatical Baptist follower, told CNN she is still in shock.\\n\\n“Up until now, my young, precious boy had no run-ins with the law, no drugs or alcohol, was a straight-A student, was in numerous extra curricular activities and played starting center on the boys Varsity basketball team,” Horner’s mother said. “But somewhere along the way he started playing on the Devil’s playground. Hopefully because of my quick thinking and actions my son will soon be able to get the help he so badly needs. I pray for it; please Jesus, save our family!”\\n\\nMs. Horner’s controversial actions have been applauded by some, for example, Lonnie Childs, president and founder of the federally funded Christian anti-masturbation organization STOP Masturbation NOW.\\n\\n“STOP Masturbation NOW ministries have nominated Martha Horner for our coveted Mother of the Year award,” Childs told reporters. “She really stepped up, provided moral discipline and leadership under such difficult conditions. My prayer app has been activated and I send this brave, courageous woman nothing but the best during these difficult times. I encourage you all all to do the same.”\\n\\nA mascot for the Christian organization, Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, told reporters he is pleased with the justice served today and is confident this will set a precedent for all the would be masturbators out there.\\n\\n“Fappy® has helped tens of thousands of adults and children around the world learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During our visits to schools around the world, our organization has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; we have done great things. Our organization is passionate about the great work that we do. The children even have a nickname for Fappy®, they call him the tickle monster. Working side by side with such great a great man as Governor Bentley, we’re ridding the demons from these heathen’s pants, one pair of pants at a time. Fappy® vows to stay on this case until justice is served!”\\n\\nOfficer Tom Downey with the Montgomery Police Department, who took the child into custody, spoke with Montgomery Fox News station WVOC about the arrest.\\n\\n“We thought at first he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about how we should leave him alone and just let him watch his ‘girl on girl action’, as he said it, makes me sick! It’s a slippery slope my friend, one day it’s masturbating to porn, the next day it’s raping some innocent school girl. Thank God we got this heathen off the streets before another tragedy could have occurred.” Downey continued, “There is no better feeling than putting the real bad guys behind bars. Nothing better than that I tell ya.

      "‘Bird Box’ Challenge: Man Crashes After Attempting To Drive Blindfolded\\nAUSTIN, TX – A 20 year old man is being hospitalized in serious condition after being involved in an automobile accident. According to witnesses, the man was driving while blindfolded. Authorities say the man was attempting the “Bird Box challenge”, a challenge that consists of attempting every day tasks while blindfolded, in this case driving a car.\\nJacob, 20, is currently being hospitalized at Austin state hospital after being involved in a serious 4 vehicle accident. All others involved in the accident walked away with minor cuts and bruises. Jacob was attempting to drive his car down 45th street blindfolded thanks to the latest internet challenge called the “Bird Box challenge”. ‘Bird Box’ is the title of a recently released Netflix horror film in which characters in the movie must be blindfolded to not be “possessed” by the evil spirits, thus the characters had to do everyday activities blindfolded.\\n“Natural selection”, says Nurse Dennis Seyih, “this is darwinism at it’s finest hour” he finished, referring to Jacob.\\nExperts are actually encouraging people to partake in this one-of-many dangerous internet challenges that

A year and a half after the series finale, in which Cranston played cancer riddled Walter White, doctors have attributed Cranston’s career’s sickness to his minor role in 2014’s reboot of the Godzilla franchise.\\n\\n“It’s a known carcinogen,” said famed oncologist Dr Hugh Hormones. “Taking small parts in disappointing remakes of classic movies is a surefire way to precipitate the disease. We warn actors time and time again, but after starring in long-running award-winning series, the temptation of getting back out there is just too great.”\\n\\nFans of the actor have come out in huge support of his ailing career, sending sympathetic tweets and reposting photos they had taken with him – most of them show the man with a still-healthy looking career.\\n\\n“Breaking Bad was always gonna be impossible to top,” tweeted TheRealJohnJonson. “#WeLoveYouWalterWhite”\\n\\n“Bryan Cranston will forever be Walter White in my heart,” posted JessePinkmanStillLives. “#IBoughtGodzillaOnBluRay #ItWasOnSale #SupportCranston”\\n\\nHowever, it seems that Cranston may not the only member of the cast of the AMC hit to be stricken with this rampant disease. Co-star Aaron Paul is said to be undergoing tests after symptoms that his own career might be deteriorating due to the incurable illness.\\n\\n“Aaron took few precautions in exposed himself to an even more severe carcinogen,” said Dr Hormones, referring to Paul’s part in the latest reimagining of the story of Moses, Exodus: Gods and Kings. In it, Paul takes the role of Joshua, whose only lines include shouting the name “Moses” unclearly. This comes hot on the heels of his action film Need For Speed, a film about fast cars that is, curiously, not based on the video game series of the same name, and is a movie that most people aren’t even aware exists.\\n\\nFamily members of both victims have announced that they will stand by their loved ones’ sides throughout, and will “fight this thing together.”\\n\\n“Aaron and Bryan at least have each other to get through it with. Their careers have for so long been interlinked, and now they will until the end,” said a family friend of Cranston’s.\\n\\nReports, however, suggest that Paul may be exposing himself to yet another possibly fatal carcinogen, with rumors placing him in the role of the scarecrow in an as yet unannounced reboot of the Hollywood classic The Wizard of Oz.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
      "Is Aspartame Responsible for ‘An Epidemic of Multiple Sclerosis and Lupus’?\\nI have spent several days lecturing at the WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL CONFERENCE on “ASPARTAME marketed as ‘NutraSweet’, ‘Equal’, and ‘Spoonful”‘. In the keynote address by the EPA, they announced that there was an epidemic of multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus, and they did not understand what toxin was causing this to be rampant across the United States. I explained that I was there to lecture on exactly that subject.\\n\\nWhen the temperature of Aspartame exceeds 86 degrees F, the wood alcohol ASPARTAME coverts to formaldehyde and then to formic acid, which in turn causes metabolic acidosis. (Formic acid is the poison found in the sting of fire ants). The methanol toxicity mimics multiple sclerosis; thus people are being diagnosed with having multiple sclerosis in error. The multiple sclerosis is not a death sentence, where methanol toxicity is.\\n\\nIn the case of systemic lupus, we are finding it has become almost as rampant as multiple sclerosis, especially Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi drinkers. Also, with methanol toxicity, the victims usually drink three to four 12 oz. cans of them per day, some even more. In the cases of systemic lupus, which is triggered by ASPARTAME, the victim usually does not know that the aspartame is the culprit. The victim continues its use aggravating the lupus to such a degree, that sometimes it becomes life threatening.\\n\\nWhen we get people off the aspartame, those with systemic lupus usually become asymptomatic. Unfortunately, we can not reverse this disease. On the other hand, in the case of those diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, (when in reality, the disease is methanol toxicity), most of the symptoms disappear. We have seen cases where their vision has returned and even their hearing has returned. This also applies to cases of tinnitus. During a lecture I said “If you are using ASPARTAME (NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, etc.) and you suffer from fibromyalgia symptoms, spasms, shooting pains, numbness in your legs, cramps, vertigo, dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, joint pain, depression, anxiety attacks, slurred speech, blurred vision, or memory loss — you probably have ASPARTAME DISEASE!”\\n\\nPeople were jumping up during the lecture saying, “I’ve got this, is it reversible?” It is rampant. Some of the speakers at my lecture even were suffering from these symptoms. In one lecture attended by the Ambassador of Uganda, he told us that their sugar industry is adding aspartame! He continued by saying that one of the industry leader’s son could no longer walk – due in part by product usage!\\n\\nWe have a very serious problem. Even a stranger came up to Dr. Espisto (one of my speakers) and myself and said, ‘Could you tell me why so many people seem to be coming down with MS? During a visit to a hospice, a nurse said that six of her friends, who were heavy Diet Coke addicts, had all been diagnosed with MS. This is beyond coincidence.\\n\\nHere is the problem. There were Congressional Hearings when aspartame was included in 100 different products. Since this initial hearing, there\\nhave been two subsequent hearings, but to no avail. Nothing as been done. The drug and chemical lobbies have very deep pockets. Now there are over\\n5,000 products containing this chemical, and the PATENT HAS EXPIRED!!!!!\\n\\nAt the time of this first hearing, people were going blind. The methanol in the aspartame converts to formaldehyde in the retina of the eye. Formaldehyde is grouped in the same class of drugs as cyanide and arsenic DEADLY POISONS!!! Unfortunately, it just takes longer to quietly kill, but it is killing people and causing all kinds of neurological problems. Aspartame changes the brain’s chemistry. It is the reason for severe seizures. This drug changes the dopamine level in the brain. Imagine what this drug does to patients suffering from Parkinson’s Disease. This drug also causes Birth Defects.\\n\\nThere is absolutely no reason to take this product. It is NOT A DIET PRODUCT!!! The Congressional record said, “It makes you crave carbohydrates and will make you FAT”. Dr. Roberts stated that when he got patients off aspartame, their average weight loss was 19 pounds per person. The formaldehyde stores in the fat cells, particularly in the hips and thighs.\\n\\nAspartame is especially deadly for diabetics. All physicians know what wood alcohol will do to a diabetic. We find that physicians believe that they have patients with retinopathy, when in fact, it is caused by the aspartame. The aspartame keeps the blood sugar level out of control, causing many patients to go into a coma. Unfortunately, many have died. People were telling us at the Conference of the American College of Physicians, that they had relatives that switched from saccharin to an aspartame product and how that relative had eventually gone into a coma. Their physicians could not get the blood sugar levels under control. Thus, the patients suffered acute memory loss and eventually coma and death.\\n\\nMemory loss is due to the fact that aspartic acid and phenylalanine are neurotoxic without the other amino acids found in protein. Thus it goes past the blood brain barrier and deteriorates the neurons of the brain. Dr. Russell Blaylock, neurosurgeon, said, “The ingredients stimulates the neurons of the brain to death, causing brain damage of varying degrees. Dr. Blaylock has written a book entitled EXCITOTOXINS: THE TASTE THAT KILLS” (Health Press 1-800-643-2665). Dr. H.J. Roberts, diabetic specialist and world expert on aspartame poisoning, has also written a book entitled DEFENSE AGAINST ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE” (1-800-814-9800). Dr. Roberts tells how aspartame poisoning is escalating Alzheimer’s Disease, and indeed it is. As the hospice nurse told me, women are being admitted at 30 years of age with Alzheimer’s Disease. Dr. Blaylock and Dr. Roberts will be writing a position paper with some case histories and will post it on the Internet.\\n\\nAccording to the Conference of the American College of Physicians, ‘We are talking about a plague of neurological diseases caused by this deadly poison”.\\n\\nDr. Roberts realized what was happening when aspartame was first marketed. He said “his diabetic patients presented memory loss, confusion, and severe vision loss”. At the Conference of the American College of Physicians, doctors admitted that they did not know. They had wondered why seizures were rampant (the phenylalanine in aspartame breaks down the seizure threshold and depletes serotonin, which causes manic depression, panic attacks, rage and violence).\\n\\nJust before the Conference, I received a FAX from Norway, asking for a possible antidote for this poison because they are experiencing so many problems in their country. This poison is now available in 90 PLUS countries worldwide. Fortunately, we had speakers and ambassadors at the Conference from different nations who have pledged their help. We ask that you help too. Print this article out and warn everyone you know. Take anything that contains aspartame back to the store.

      "CHINA: MINER FOUND ALIVE AFTER 17 YEARS UNDERGROUND\\nWhile they were exploring the galleries, they stumbled upon Cheung Wai, a 59-year-old survivor from the 2001 accident, obviously in a rather bad shape.\\n\\nWai was immediately taken to the hospital where a complete evaluation of his physical and mental states will be done over the next weeks.\\n\\nThe poor man had remained trapped underground with the bodies of 78 of his dead coworkers after an earthquake of a magnitude of 7,8 hit the region and caused the wooden support structure of the mine to crumble and collapse.\\n\\nSomehow lucky in his misfortune, Mr. Cheung was saved by the fact that a ventilation duct still connected his underground prison to the surface, allowing him access to air that was sufficiently pure to keep him alive.\\nWai managed to survive thanks to an emergency stash of rice and water, stored in an underground depot, conceived especially for this kind of case.\\n\\nThe man complemented his diet by catching and eating the countless rats that pullulate in the mine, as well as collecting large quantities of some sort of phosphorescent moss, which constituted his only source of vitamins. \\nEven though Wai was suffering from great physical and mental stress, he managed to give proper burials to all of his comrades, spending almost a year in this great selfless act.\\n\\nMining accidents remain common in China, despite growing measures by the government to reduce the problem, which killed more than 4000 miners a year at the beginning of the millennium.\\n\\nOver the last years, the authorities have been cracking down on many unregulated mining operations which account for almost 80 percent of the country’s 16,000 mines.\\n\\nThe closure of about 1,000 dangerous small mines last year helped to cut in half the average number of miners killed, to about six a day, in the first months of this year, according to government statistics.\\n\\nThe case of Mr. Cheung remains unique, however, and constitutes a world record, according to the universally recognized authority on record-breaking achievement, Guinness.\\nThe former record for surviving underground was of 142 days and was held by a British man named Geoff Smith. He had been voluntarily buried in the backyard of the Railway Inn, his favorite pub, with the intention of breaking the record.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
      "RED SEA: ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER REMAINS OF EGYPTIAN ARMY FROM THE BIBLICAL EXODUS\\nSuez | Egypt’s Antiquities Ministry announced this morning that a team of underwater archaeologists had discovered that remains of a large Egyptian army from the 14th century BC, at the bottom of the Gulf of Suez, 1.5 kilometers offshore from the modern city of  Ras Gharib.\\nThe team was searching for the remains of ancient ships and artifacts related to Stone Age and Bronze Age trade in the Red Sea area when they stumbled upon a gigantic mass of human bones darkened by age.\\n\\nThe scientists led by Professor Abdel Muhammad Gader and associated with Cairo University’s Faculty of Archaeology, have already recovered a total of more than 400 different skeletons, as well as hundreds of weapons and pieces of armor.\\n\\nThe remains of two war chariots were also discovered scattered over an area of approximately 200 square meters.\\n\\nThey estimate that more than 5,000 other bodies could be dispersed over a wider area, suggesting that an army of large size may have perished on the site.\\n\\nThis magnificient blade from an egyptian khopesh, was certainly the weapon of an important character. It was discovered near the remains of a highly decorated war chariot, suggesting it could have belonged to a prince or nobleman.\\nMany clues on the site have brought Professor Gader and his team to conclude that the bodies could be linked to the famous episode of the Exodus.\\n\\nFirst of all, the ancient soldiers seem to have died on dry ground, since no traces of boats or ships have been found in the area.\\n\\nThe positions of the bodies and the fact that they were stuck in a vast quantity of clay and rock imply that they could have died in a mudslide or a tidal wave.\\nThe sheer number of bodies suggests that a large ancient army perished on the site, and the dramatic way by which they were killed, seem to corroborate the biblical version of the Red Sea Crossing when the army of the Egyptian Pharaoh was destroyed by the returning waters that Moses had parted.\\n\\nThis new find certainly proves that there was indeed an Egyptian army of large size that was destroyed by the waters of the Red Sea during the reign of King Akhenaten.\\n\\nThe famous biblical account of the \"Red Sea Crossing\" was dismisseded by many scholars and historians as more symbolic than historical.\\nFor centuries, the famous biblical account of the “Red Sea Crossing” was dismissed by most scholars and historians as more symbolic than historical.\\n\\n“This astounding discovery brings undeniable scientific proof that one the most famous episodes of the Old Testament was indeed based on a historical event,” Professor Gader said during the press conference.\\n“It brings a brand new perspective on a story that many historians have been considering for years as a work of fiction and suggesting that other biblical stories like the Plagues of Egypt could indeed have a historical base.\\n\\nA lot more research and many more recovery operations are to be expected on the site over the next few years, as Professor Gader and his team have already announced their desire to retrieve the rest of the bodies and artefacts from was has turned out to be one of the richest archaeological underwater sites ever discovered.\\n

      "Dell Keyboard Loggers\\nI was opening up my almost brand new Dell 600m laptop, to replace a broken PCMCIA slot riser on the motherboard. As soon as I got the keyboard off, I noticed a small cable running from the keyboard connection underneath a piece of metal protecting the motherboard.\\nI figured “No Big Deal”, and continued with the dissasembly. But when I got the metal panels off, I saw a small white heatshink-wrapped package. Being ever-curious, I sliced the heatshrink open. I found a little circuit board inside. Being an EE by trade, this piqued my curiosity considerably. On one side of the board, one Atmel AT45D041A four megabit Flash memory chip. On the other side, one Microchip Technology PIC16F876 Programmable Interrupt Controller, along with a little Fairchild Semiconductor CD4066BCM quad bilateral switch.\\n\\nLooking further, I saw that the other end of the cable was connected to the integrated ethernet board.\\n\\nWhat could this mean? I called Dell tech support about it, and they said, and I quote, “The intregrated service tag identifier is there for assisting customers in the event of lost or misplaced personal information.” He then hung up. A little more research, and I found that that board spliced in between the keyboard and the ethernet chip is little more than a Keyghost hardware keylogger.\\n

      "Russia Warns Obama: Global War Over “Bee Apocalypse” Coming Soon\\nThe shocking minutes relating to President Putin’s meeting this past week with US Secretary of State John Kerry reveal the Russian leaders “extreme outrage” over the Obama regimes continued protection of global seed and plant bio-genetic giants Syngenta and Monsanto in the face of a growing “bee apocalypse” that the Kremlin warns “will most certainly” lead to world war.\\nAccording to these minutes, released in the Kremlin today by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation (MNRE), Putin was so incensed over the Obama regime’s refusal to discuss this grave matter that he refused for three hours to even meet with Kerry, who had traveled to Moscow on a scheduled diplomatic mission, but then relented so as to not cause an even greater rift between these two nations.The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RS) today has issued an “Extreme Danger” warning for all vessels entering or nearing the United States Port of Mobile, located in the State of Alabama, as the death toll rises from what this report claims is an environmental disaster related to the flowering of genetically modified cotton crops located in this region.\\nAccording to this report, RS officials became “highly concerned” this past week after the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) reported that at least 2 people have died, and another 5 put in hospital, due to a “mysterious illness” attacking the respiratory systems of those affected and causing flu-like symptoms.\\n

      "John Cena Accidentally Says “You Can’t See Me” To A Blind Kid\\nDuring one of his many meet-and-greet sessions at children’s hospitals across the nation, John Cena made an embarrassing gaffe by saying “You can’t see me” to a little blind boy.\\nCena waved his right hand in front of his face, flashed a friendly smile and said “You can’t see me” to 11-year-old Timothy Greene, who suffers from a degenerative neurological disorder that affects his optic nerves.\\nAn awkward hush fell over the lounge in Manhattan Pediatric Hospital, where several children and their parents were gathered for the much-anticipated meeting with Cena.\\nA WWE public relations associate then whispered to Cena that Timothy is legally blind, which caused Cena to turn pale and stammer something about “hustle, loyalty and respect.”\\nTimothy later said he wasn’t bothered by Cena’s comment, and insisted he found the whole thing kind of funny.\\n“Cena sucks anyway,” he said. “I’m a CM Punk fan.”\\n\\n

      "Doctors Admit “Crystal Meth Is\\nActually Good For You”\\nDoctors have today admitted that they have been wrong about crystal meth this whole time and that the powerful narcotic is actually amazingly beneficial for health and well being.\\n“It increases concentration and drive, providing a much needed energy boost for the carrying out of petty crimes and handbag robberies,” confirmed Department of Health spokesperson Dr. William Gould. “A strict diet of crystal meth is shown to improve brain function making it easier to count coins collected on the street by begging with a coffee cup.”\\nDr. Gould claimed that crystal meth contains “zero saturated fats and is perfect for people who are on a low carb diet” while also providing “100% of your daily methamphetamine needs”.\\n“A strict crystal meth diet also helps people shed unwanted pounds, hair and teeth and promotes the growth of healthy scabs and unclean fingernails,” continued the report which assessed the health of 1000 meth addicts and concluded that they had the rugged lean health of a 19th century street urchin with taut, tense muscles from constant alertness coupled with an immunity to most infections from living in their own filth for long periods at a time.\\n“It’s absolutely fantastic as an appetite suppressant, often meth users will simply forget about having to eat which will eliminate a flabby stomach and give the face a beautiful sunken emaciated look,” continued Dr. Gould who recommended that crystal meth should be enjoyed as part of a healthy diet that involves plenty of alcohol, cigarettes and unprotected sex.\\n“If people follow the crystal meth diet then they can expect to see results ranging from a reduction in unwanted bone density, a decrease in harmful bowel movements and removal of unwanted restorative sleep, within mere days of trying the super drug.”\\nCrystal is available from all good health food outlets, dodgy blokes on motorcycles and Silk Road.\\n\\n

      "Military to Pledge Oath To Obama, Not Constitution\\nSecretary of Defense Robert Gates is extremely frustrated with orders that the White House is contemplating. According to sources at the Pentagon, including all branches of the armed forces, the Obama Administration may break with a centuries-old tradition.\\n\\nA spokesman for General James Cartwright, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, states that the Obama Administration wants to have soldiers and officers pledge a loyalty oath directly to the office of the President, and no longer to the Constitution.\\n\\n\"The oath to the Constitution is as old as the document itself.\" the spokesman said, \"At no time in American history, not even in the Civil War, did the oath change or the subject of the oath differ. It has always been to the Constitution.\"\\n\\nThe back-and-forth between the White House and the Defense Department was expected as President George W. Bush left office. President Obama has already signed orders to close Guantanamo and to pull combat troops from Iraq. But, this, say many at the Defense Department, goes too far.\\n\\n\"Technically, we can't talk about it before it becomes official policy.\" the spokesman continued. \"However, the Defense Department, including the Secretary, will not take this laying down. Expect a fight from the bureaucracy and the brass.\"\\n\\nSources at the White House had a different point of view. In a circular distributed by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, the rationale for the change was made more clear.\\n\\n\"The President feels that the military has been too indoctrinated by the old harbingers of hate: nationalism, racism, and classism. By removing an oath to the American society, the soldiers are less likely to commit atrocities like those at Abu Ghraib.\"\\n\\n\"We expect a lot of flak over this,\" the classified memo continues. \"But those that would be most against it are those looking either for attention or control.\"\\n\\nThe time frame for the changes are unknown. However, it is more likely that the changes will be made around the July 4th holiday, in order to dampen any potential backlash. The difference in the oath will actually only be slight. The main differences will be the new phrasing. It is expected that the oath to the Constitution will be entirely phased out within two years.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

      "Obama’s Troubling Internet Fund-Raising\\nWHERE IS THE MONEY COMING FROM ?\\n\\nBy MAUREEN DOWD\\nPublished: June 29, 2008\\n\\nOBAMA’S TROUBLING INTERNET FUND RAISING\\n\\nCertainly the most interesting and potentially devastating phone call I have received during this election cycle came this week from one of the Obama’s campaign internet geeks. These are the staffers who devised Obama’s internet fund raising campaign which raised in the neighborhood of $200 million so far. That is more then twice the total funds raised by any candidate in history — and this was all from the internet campaign.\\n\\nWhat I learned from this insider was shocking but I guess we shouldn’t be surprised that when it comes to fund raising there simply are no rules that can’t be broken and no ethics that prevail.\\n\\nObama’s internet campaign started out innocently enough with basic e-mail networking, lists saved from previous party campaigns and from\\n\\nsupporters who visited any of the Obama campaign web sites. Small contributions came in from these sources and the internet campaign staff were more than pleased by the results.\\n\\nThen, about two months into the campaign the daily contribution intake multiplied. Where was it coming from? One of the web site security monitors began to notice the bulk of the contributions were clearly coming in from overseas internet service providers and at the rate and frequency of transmission it was clear these donations were “programmed” by a very sophisticated user.\\n\\nWhile the security people were not able to track most of the sources due to firewalls and other blocking devices put on these contributions they were able to collate the number of contributions that were coming in seemingly from individuals but the funds were from only a few credit card accounts and bank electronic funds transfers. The internet service providers (ISP) they were able to trace were from Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other Middle Eastern countries. One of the banks used for fund transfers was also located in Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nAnother concentrated group of donations was traced to a Chinese ISP with a similar pattern of limited credit card charges.\\n\\nIt became clear that these donations were very likely coming from sources other than American voters. This was discussed at length within the campaign and the decision was made that none of these donations violated campaign financing laws.\\n\\nIt was also decided that it was not the responsibility of the campaign to audit these millions of contributions as to the actual source (specific credit card number or bank transfer account numbers) to insure that none of these internet contributors exceeded the legal maximum donation on a cumulative basis of many small donations. They also found the record keeping was not complete enough to do it anyway.\\n\\nThis is a shocking revelation.\\n\\nWe have been concerned about the legality of “bundling” contributions after the recent exposure of illegal bundlers but now it appears we may have an even greater problem.\\n\\nI guess we should have been somewhat suspicious when the numbers started to come out. We were told (no proof offered) that the Obama internet contributions were from $10.00 to $25.00 or so.\\n\\nIf the $200,000,000 is right, and the average contribution was $15.00, that would mean over 13 million individuals made contributions? That would also be 13 million contributions would need to be processed. How did all that happen?\\n\\nI believe the Obama campaign’s internet fund raising needs a serious, in depth investigation and audit.

      "New Research Suggest That Men Who Cheat On Their Spouse Are More Honest And Emotional\\nThis, of course, begs the question: Why? Why do men really cheat? And why do they sometimes continue cheating after they’re caught, even in the face of profoundly unwanted consequences like divorce, loss of parental contact, loss of social standing, and the like?\\nThe truth is that all sorts of dynamics can play into a man’s decision to engage in infidelity. Generally, though, his choice to cheat is driven by one or more of the following factors:\\nLove: Most men cheat because they just love so much they can’t control themselves and sometimes this leads to cheating but he cheats because he a lover.\\nHonesty: Sometime a man is so honest with another woman it might lead to a sexual encounter with another female.\\nEmotional: Men try not to show their emotions but like anyone sometimes they need a shoulder to cry on and this may lead to accidental cheating\\nAccidental: Most men don’t cheat purposely sometimes is accidental forgiving your man for accidentally cheating can help you build a better relationship with your partner.\\nIt’s Your Fault: Most men don’t cheat because they are tempted but pushed by their spouse to cheat you have to look in the mirror and ask yourself what are you doing wrong\\n\\n

      "29 Humans Killed in Laboratory\\nProducing Militarized Artificial\\nIntelligence Robots\\nJAPAN – 29 scientist were killed by militarized artificial intelligence robots.\\nJapan begun working on creating AI militarized robots back in 2006 Japan\\ndenied the programs existence but the proof is inevitable.\\n\\nDexter who runs the laboratory managed to escape the fiasco told the story\\nof the accident. Japanese military opened fire on these militarized robots\\nwhile scientist shut them down but one ran and begun to fix itself\\ndownloading files to repair itself via orbit satellite. This was kept secret until\\na whistle blower confirmed the incident. As of now Dexter’s laboratory is still\\na secret to his family except for Dee-Dee who is always messing around in\\nthere.\\n\\nAI will inevitably become a necessity to business just as computers are\\ntoday.

      "Jaden Smith Says He is a Prophet and God Inspired his New Fashion Line 666\\nJaden Smith, the son of rapper-actor legend Will Smith, has announced a new fashion line, which he titled “666.” Despite 666 being highly regarded as an evil number which references the mark of the beast, Jaden says the fashion line was inspired by God.\\n\\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Jaden spoke about his fashion line:\\n\\n“God exists in all things that surround the fire that burns in the sky. She is responsible for all spontaneous ideas. In fact, 666 is not an evil number. This number is actually three part and represents the six angels that descended from the six Heavens, who are searching for the six prophets who are meant to lead the masses. Each prophet will be the exalted leader of that heaven. I have been chosen by one of those angels as one of those prophets. This line is not just clothing. Clothing is meant to cover, while 666 is meant to transform. To wear these clothes is to seek protection from the ills of the world and to pledge allegiance to my Heaven.”\\n\\nJaden revealed the line will feature non-traditional clothing for men to include tunics, dresses, long shirts, leather, and more.Jaden, along with his sister Willow, have become synonymous with off-the-wall thinking. Late last year the brother and sister spoke about prana energy and why schooling was overrated.\\nWhen asked about their experience with time, Willow and Jaden stated:\\n\\nWILLOW: I mean, time for me, I can make it go slow or fast, however I please, and that’s how I know it doesn’t exist.\\n\\nJADEN: It’s proven that how time moves for you depends on where you are in the universe. It’s relative to beings and other places. But on the level of being here on earth, if you are aware in a moment, one second can last a year. And if you are unaware, your whole childhood, your whole life can pass by in six seconds. But it’s also such a thing that you can get lost in.\\n\\nWILLOW: Because living.JADEN: Right, because you have to live.

      "I have only heard the story behind this picture...\\nI have only heard the story behind this picture once, but it literally brought tears to my eyes. On September 11, 2001, a hijacked plane knifed into the side of the Pentagon. We all know that. What very few people have heard is shortly afterwards, the director of a nursery in the building stood looking at the children in her charge, wondering how to move all of the babies and toddlers to safety.\\n\\nA marine rushed into the room and asked if she was alright. She needed help and she told him that. He turned and ran out; the woman assumed that he had gone away for good. As she formulated a plan of action, she heard footsteps in the hall.\\n\\nThe man had returned—this time, though, he was not alone. At least forty other Marines followed him. They picked up the babies in their cribs, the toddlers, the helpless infants. They carried them through the halls and to a nearby park, where they arranged the cribs in a circle and set the toddlers in the middle. Then they stood guard outside, never allowing the children to be unattended.\\n\\nWhen I first saw this picture, I thought that the man carrying the children was their father. Now I realize that he was not related to them by blood, but by nationality. He is an American. They are American children. He is not their father, he is their protector. He’s a United States Marine.\\n\\n#USMC #USA\\n

      "Change at the White House\\nFor a long time, we have noticed that the decor at the White House has changed since BHO moved in. \\n\\nThe Oval Office is now stripped of the traditional red, white, and blue, and replaced with middle eastern wallpaper, drapes, and decor. \\nThe hallway that he walks out of to talk to the press now has middle eastern chairs, drapes, etc. And the thing that has bothered me the most is the bright yellow drape behind him every time he speaks from the white house. \\n\\nIt has Arabic symbols on it and has been there from the beginning. \\n\\nToday I received this and it clearly shows what I have been noticing. That bright yellow curtain is highly visible, but as you scroll down, you will see what is predominantly absent. Also, as you look at the pictures of other presidents speaking from the same spot, look at the traditional 'American' background and decor as opposed to the new decor. Trust me when I say that this is intentional. It should alarm every American.\\n\\nWhat is missing at Barack Hussein Obama's press conference? \\n\\nNo it is not the teleprompters. See the other president's pics for a clue.\\n\\nBARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA (aka Barry \"The Kenyan\" Soetoro)\\n\\nThat's right ... no American flags!\\n\\nAnd I don't believe it was just an accident! It is intentional. So I ask, why is it intentional? He told you he would change America, didn't he? This man, whoever he really is, is not an American. He and his ilk want to end the American Free Enterprise System.\\n\\nHow do you like Socialism now?\\n\\nVote in November like your way of life depends on it! Because it does!\\n\\n

      "Hobby Lobby Stones Gay Employee to Death\\nManagers at a Hobby Lobby store in Arkansas stoned to death an employee today for being gay.\\n\\nAccording to a report in the Ozark Post-Gazette, the store’s management decided to execute Jeremy Gleason, 43, in an alley behind the store in accordance with the Biblical verseLeviticus 20:13, which commands believers to kill homosexual men.\\n\\nThe assailants reportedly tied Gleason to a pole and threw large chunks of granite and whole bricks at his body. An autopsy later revealed the adoptive father of 2 young children died of blunt force trauma to the head.\\n\\nAlthough Gleason’s family have called for Hobby Lobby’s managers to be charged with murder, police say they do not intend to make any arrests in the case because the store was simply exercising its religious beliefs.\\n\\n“I don’t really see the problem here,” says Mark Patterson, Wilson County sheriff, “I mean stoning gays to death is in the Bible. And Hobby Lobby is a Christian company.\\n\\n“What am I supposed to do? Arrest the people who killed him? Last I checked this was America. We don’t put people in jail for exercising their religion.”\\n\\nGleason’s unusual execution comes just days after the US Supreme Court ruled that his employer may be exempted from a federal law requiring employers to provide contraceptive coverage to their employees.\\n

      "Fox News Classified Satire By FCC\\nThere has been an ongoing dispute about the legitimacy of the content put out by Fox News. Between the amount of complaints and discredited stories by varying myth-busting sources, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has now reclassified Fox News from a valid news source to that of satire.\\n\\nThe FCC cannot classify Fox News as purely entertainment-based fiction because their stories contain the names, places and actions of legitimacy. This decision to classify Fox News as satire did not come easily, because many see the news network as well-founded and they should have the freedom of speech to report as they so choose.\\n\\nA statement put out by the FCC says, “The decision to classify Fox News as satire has come after several years of evaluation regarding the sources of their reporting and the bias of their programming. While much of their content is based on legitimate news, it is spun is a way that cannot not be deemed newsworthy to the viewing public. If Fox News so chooses to report actual news stories of legitimacy without skewing the content we may overturn our decision and reclassify the network to a valid news source once again.”\\n\\nIt seems the FCC is leaving the decision to be an actual news source up to the programming directors and others in charge at News Corp. Both Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes have not been able to be reached for comment.\\n\\nAs far as programming, it will be business as usual, but there will now be a running disclaimer along the bottom of the viewing screen that states, “This is not a valid news source.”\\n

      "POPE FRANCIS CONDEMNS RACISM AND DECLARES THAT “ALL RELIGIONS ARE TRUE” AT HISTORIC THIRD VATICAN COUNCIL\\nFor the last six months, Catholic cardinals, bishops and theologians have been deliberating in Vatican City, discussing the future of the church and redefining long-held Catholic doctrines and dogmas. The Third Vatican Council, is undoubtedly the largest and most important since the Second Vatican Council was concluded in 1962. Pope Francis convened the new council to “finally finish the work of the Second Vatican Council.” While some traditionalists and conservative reactionaries on the far right have decried these efforts, they have delighted progressives around the world.\\nTo a chorus of thunderous applause, Pope Francis stated “because Muslims, Hindus and African Animists are also made in the very likeness and image of God, to hate them is to hate God! To reject them to is to reject God and the Gospel of Christ. Whether we worship at a church, a synagogue, a mosque or a mandir, it does not matter. Whether we call God, Jesus, Adonai, Allah or Krishna, we all worship the same God of love. This truth is self-evident to all who have love and humility in their hearts!”\\n\\nIn a speech that shocked many, the Pope claimed “All religions are true, because they are true in the hearts of all those who believe in them. What other kind of truth is there? In the past, the church has been harsh on those it deemed morally wrong or sinful. Today, we no longer judge. Like a loving father, we never condemn our children. Our church is big enough for heterosexuals and homosexuals, for the pro-life and the pro-choice! For conservatives and liberals, even communists are welcome and have joined us. We all love and worship the same God.”\\n

      "World Gun Violence Has Been Reportedly Declining Since Apple’s Gun Emoji Change In 2016\\nWORLDWIDE – According to world health reports, worldwide gun violence has been steadily declining since Apple replaced the gun emoji with a water gun back in August 2016 for ios 10.\\nAccording to researchers, there was a steady increase in worldwide gun violence since the 1970s, peaking at 251,000,000 in 2015. However in 2016, with the change of Apples gun emoji to a water gun, worldwide gun violence has been on an unprecedented decline, with only 900 gun related crimes in 2017, and an all time low of only 5 gun related crimes so far in 2018. Gun violence has almost disappeared completely thanks to Apple.\\n“Thank God for apple”, says Tom Gill of the American Medical Association, “who would’ve known that the key to a better world was just an emoji change away”.\\nResearchers predict that 2019 will have only 1 gun related crime, with the offender praised rather than punished, for completing the achievement of being the only human on earth to commit a gun related crime that year.\\n\\n

If Barack Obama would apply for a job with the FBI or with the Secret Service, he would be disqualified because of his past associations with William Ayers, a known (and unrepentant) terrorist. If elected President, he would not qualify to be his own body guard! Ayers was a founder in 1969 of the violent antiwar group the Weathermen, which took responsibility for at least 12 bombings between 1970 and 1974. A pipe bomb attributed to the group killed a police officer and severely injured another in 1970, and three of the group's own members were killed in a 1970 explosion in a Greenwich Village townhouse in which they were making bombs. Ayers was investigated in connection with the group's activities, but the charges were dropped in 1974 due to prosecutorial misconduct. He emerged from hiding, earned a doctorate in education from Columbia University, and is now a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Like Obama, he lives on the South Side of Chicago.\\n\\nObama and Ayers are both active in politics and civic life in the city. They both volunteered at two different charities, the Woods Foundation and the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, and Ayers hosted a small gathering for Obama and then-state Sen. Alice Palmer in 1995 as Obama planned to run for the seat Palmer was vacating.\\n

      "Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was made to disappear so one party could gain control of a multiply-owned patent.\\n\\n\\nHere’s what you all need to know. Spread this information everywhere:\\n\\nFour days after the missing flight MH370 a patent is approved by the Patent Office\\n\\n4 of the 5 Patent holders are Chinese employees of Freescale Semiconductor of Austin TX.\\n\\nPatent is divided up on 20% increments to 5 holders:\\n\\nPeidong Wang, Suzhou, China, (20%)\\nZhijun Chen, Suzhou, China, (20%)\\nZhihong Cheng, Suzhou, China, (20%)\\nLi Ying, Suzhou, China, (20%)\\nFreescale Semiconductor (20%)\\n\\nIf a patent holder dies, then the remaining holders equally share the dividends of the deceased if not disputed in a will.\\n\\nIf 4 of the 5 dies, then the remaining 1 Patent holder gets 100% of the wealth of the patent.\\n\\nThat remaining live Patent holder is Freescale Semiconductor.\\n\\nWho owns Freescale Semiconductor?\\n\\nJacob Rothschild through Blackstone (what an interesting name for a company) who owns Freescale.\\n\\nHere is your motive for the missing plane. As all 4 Chinese members of the Patent were passengers on the missing plane, and that patent was the breakthrough. We have entered the future proper, and four men was just murdered so that the last, still living member can keep this for himself to either hide or profit from.\\n

      "NRA President Jim Porter: “It’s Only A Matter Of Time Before We Can Own Colored People Again”\\nHOUSTON — It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.\\n\\n“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”\\n\\nWhen asked to clarify Porter said,\\n\\n“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”\\n\\nSeveral at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”\\n\\nIt’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments. Free Wood Post will keep you up to date as this story unfolds.\\n

      "Michele Bachmann Wants to Ban Halloween?\\nMichele Bachmann, Republican Congressional Representative to Minnesota and founder of the Tea Party Caucus, is at it again. She is calling for a ban on Halloween, stating, “This holiday is based in Satanism. It’s a Pagan ritual to worship Satan and call him forth to the earth and the liberal elites have added socialism to it. We are in the end days and we must purify our nation if we are to be welcomed into the kingdom of God.”\\n“We have to ban Halloween to save the children. That’s how they indoctrinate them you know. Giving them Satan’s candy sacks. Soon you’ve got a country full of children sucking on Satan’s sacks and thinking liberal thoughts instead of good Christian ones.”\\n

      "Florida’s “Neck Guy” Arrested\\nAgain Undergoes Plastic\\nSurgery To Decrease Neck Size\\nAnd Removes Tattoos; His\\nMugshot Had To Be Updated\\nFLORIDA – After Charles Dion Mcdowell was arrested for drug charges earlier this week, he has become an internet sensation for his abnormally sized neck, drawing jokes by thousands of social media users. According to reports, Charles could not handle the jokes and decided to surgically decrease the size of his neck with the permission of a judge.\\nAccording to reports, Charles Dion Mcdowell reportedly begged the judge to allow him to undergo plastic surgery to make his neck “normal”, the judge reportedly felt “so bad” for Charles that permission was granted. “How could i say no” said Judge John Joyce, “the man looked like Bane from Batman”.\\nCharles Dion Mcdowell emerged a new man, with his neck drastically smaller than before. Florida police retook his mugshot as his appearance underwent a noticeable change. Charles then got what remained of his neck tattoo removed, as a large portion of it was removed during surgery along with neck tissue and skin.\\nCharles is currently out on bond but a new mugshot had to be taken to update police records.\\n\\n
